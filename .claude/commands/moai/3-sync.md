# MoAI-ADK Step 3: Document Synchronization (+Optional PR Ready)

User Interaction Architecture: AskUserQuestion must be used at COMMAND level only. Subagents via Task() are stateless and cannot interact with users. Collect all approvals BEFORE delegating to agents.

Batched Design: All AskUserQuestion calls follow batched design principles (1-4 questions per call, max 4 options per question). See CLAUDE.md section "User Interaction Architecture" for details.

4-Step Workflow Integration: This command implements Step 4 of Alfred's workflow (Report & Commit with conditional report generation). See CLAUDE.md for full workflow details.

---

## Command Purpose

[HARD] This command orchestrates ONLY - delegates all sync work to manager-docs agent

Document sync target: $ARGUMENTS

Agent Delegation Pattern:

Correct Approach [HARD]:

- Invoke Task() with subagent_type="manager-docs"
- Pass complete context including changed files and verification results
- Let manager-docs agent determine implementation strategy
- WHY: Specialized agent has domain expertise and handles all complexity

Forbidden Approach:

- Direct file manipulation using Edit, Write, Read tools
- Direct bash execution of document updates
- WHY: Bypasses quality controls and loses context-specific error handling

Standard Workflow Sequence:
Step 1 (Analysis & Planning) leads to Step 2 (Document Sync via Agent) leads to Step 3 (Git Commit & PR)

---

## Execution Modes

This command supports 4 operational modes:

- **auto** (default): Smart selective sync
  - Scope: Selectively syncs changed files only
  - PR Processing: PR Ready conversion
  - Use Case: Daily development workflow

- **force**: Full project re-sync
  - Scope: Complete regeneration of all documentation
  - PR Processing: Full regeneration
  - Use Case: Error recovery, major refactoring

- **status**: Status check only
  - Scope: Read-only health check
  - PR Processing: Report only
  - Use Case: Quick health check

- **project**: Integrated project-wide
  - Scope: Project-wide documentation updates
  - PR Processing: Project-level updates
  - Use Case: Milestone completion, periodic sync

Command usage examples:

- `/moai:3-sync` → Auto-sync (PR Ready only)
- `/moai:3-sync --auto-merge` → PR auto-merge + branch cleanup
- `/moai:3-sync force` → Force full synchronization
- `/moai:3-sync status` → Check synchronization status
- `/moai:3-sync project` → Integrated project synchronization
- `/moai:3-sync auto src/auth/` → Specific path synchronization
- `/moai:3-sync --worktree` → Sync in worktree mode (with worktree exit options)
- `/moai:3-sync --branch` → Sync in branch mode (with branch management options)

---

## Associated Agents

- **manager-docs**: Synchronize Living Documents with code changes
  - Responsible for analyzing Git changes and executing documentation updates
  - Handles SPEC synchronization and domain-specific documentation

- **manager-quality**: Verify project integrity and TRUST 5 compliance
  - Performs automated code review and quality validation
  - Ensures documentation meets quality standards

- **manager-git**: Handle Git operations and commit management
  - Creates commits for documentation changes
  - Manages PR transitions and branch operations

---

## Agent Invocation Patterns (CLAUDE.md Compliance)

[HARD] AGENT DELEGATION MANDATE:

- ALL synchronization tasks MUST be delegated to specialized agents (manager-docs, manager-quality, manager-git)
- NEVER execute documentation sync directly, even after auto compact
- WHY: Specialized agents have domain expertise for Living Document patterns, TRUST 5 validation, and Git operations
- This rule applies regardless of session state or context recovery

This command uses agent execution patterns defined in CLAUDE.md (lines 96-120).

### Sequential Phase-Based Chaining PASS

Command implements sequential chaining through 3 core phases:

Phase Flow:

- Phase 1: Analysis & Planning (manager-docs analyzes changed files and sync scope)
- Phase 2: Execute Sync (manager-docs updates documentation, manager-quality validates)
- Phase 3: Git Operations & PR (manager-git creates commits and prepares PR if applicable)

Each phase receives outputs from previous phases as context.

WHY: Sequential execution ensures documentation consistency and validation

- Phase 2 requires analysis results from Phase 1 to determine sync scope
- Phase 3 requires validated documentation from Phase 2 before commit
- PR creation requires successful commit from Phase 3

IMPACT: Skipping phases would create inconsistent documentation or invalid commits

### Parallel Execution WARNING

Limited parallel execution within Phase 2 for independent documentation files

WHY: Some documentation files can be generated simultaneously

- Multiple markdown files without cross-references can be updated in parallel
- Index updates and validation must remain sequential

IMPACT: Full parallel execution would risk broken cross-references and index inconsistencies

### Resumable Agent Support FAIL

Not applicable - command typically completes quickly in single execution

WHY: Documentation sync is fast operation (usually under 2 minutes)

- Most sync operations complete in first attempt
- File system operations are atomic and recoverable
- No long-running processes requiring checkpoints

IMPACT: Resume pattern unnecessary for typical sync workflows

---

Refer to CLAUDE.md "Agent Chaining Patterns" (lines 96-120) for complete pattern architecture.

---

## Execution Philosophy: "Sync to Verify to Commit"

/moai:3-sync performs documentation synchronization through complete agent delegation:

Execution Flow:

- User Command: /moai:3-sync [mode] [path]
- /moai:3-sync Command delegates to Task with subagent_type set to manager-docs or manager-quality or manager-git
  - Phase 1: Analysis and Planning (manager-docs)
  - Phase 2: Execute Sync (manager-docs plus manager-quality)
  - Phase 3: Git Operations and PR (manager-git)
- Output: Synchronized docs plus commit plus PR Ready (conditional)

### Tool Usage Guidelines

This command has access to all tools for flexibility:

- Task() for agent orchestration (recommended for complex tasks)
- AskUserQuestion() for user interaction at command level
- TodoWrite() for progress tracking
- Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep for direct operations when needed

Agent delegation is recommended for complex tasks that benefit from specialized expertise. Direct tool usage is permitted when appropriate for simpler operations.

## Output Format

### Output Format Rules

[HARD] User-Facing Reports: Always use Markdown formatting for user communication. Never display XML tags to users.
WHY: Users expect readable formatted text, not markup
IMPACT: XML tags in user output create confusion and reduce comprehension

[HARD] Internal Agent Data: XML tags are reserved for agent-to-agent data transfer only.
WHY: XML structure enables automated parsing for downstream agent coordination
IMPACT: Using XML for user output degrades user experience

### User-Facing Output (Markdown)

Progress reports must use Markdown with clear sections:

- **Analysis**: Project state assessment and findings
- **Plan**: Synchronization strategy and rationale
- **Execution**: Actions taken and files modified
- **Verification**: Quality gate results
- **Completion**: Summary and next steps

### Internal Agent Communication (XML)

For agent-to-agent data transfer only (never displayed to users):

```xml
<analysis>Detailed assessment of project state, identified changes, and validation results</analysis>
<plan>Synchronization strategy including scope, affected documents, and approach rationale</plan>
<execution>Concrete actions taken: files updated, reports generated, status changes recorded</execution>
<verification>Quality validation results: TRUST 5 compliance, link integrity, consistency checks</verification>
<completion>Summary of outcomes, generated reports locations, and next steps for user</completion>
```

Required Elements for Internal Communication:

- Analysis must detail all findings from project validation and Git analysis
- Plan must explain strategy choice including WHY and IMPACT of decisions
- Execution must track all agent actions and file modifications
- Verification must report all quality gates and their outcomes
- Completion must guide user toward next meaningful action

WHY: XML sections provide machine-parseable structure for agent coordination and enable audit trails.

## PHASE 1: Analysis & Planning

Goal: Gather project context, verify project status, and get user approval.

### Step 1.1: Verify Prerequisites & Load Skills

Execute these verification steps:

1. [HARD] TUI System Must Be Ready:

   Requirement: Interactive menus must be available for all user interactions
   WHY: User interaction requires responsive feedback mechanism
   IMPACT: Missing TUI will cause command to fail during user approval phase

2. [HARD] MoAI-ADK Structure Must Exist:

   Requirement: `.moai/` directory must exist in project root
   Requirement: `.claude/` directory must exist in project root
   Failure Action: Print error message with missing directory details and exit immediately
   WHY: These directories contain essential project metadata and configuration
   IMPACT: Missing directories indicates incomplete project initialization

3. [HARD] Git Repository Must Be Initialized:

   Requirement: Project must be inside a Git repository
   Verification: Execute `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` and verify output is "true"
   Failure Action: Print error message and exit immediately
   WHY: Document synchronization requires Git history and commit operations
   IMPACT: Non-Git projects cannot track documentation changes or create commits

4. [SOFT] Python Environment Should Be Available:

   Requirement: Python 3 should be installed and accessible
   Verification: Execute `which python3` and verify command succeeds
   Failure Action: Print warning message but continue with reduced functionality
   WHY: Python environment enables advanced automation and validation
   IMPACT: Missing Python limits automation but does not prevent basic sync operations

Result: All hard prerequisites verified. All soft requirements checked. Command may proceed to next step.

---

### Step 1.2: Analyze Project Status

Gather context for synchronization planning:

1. [HARD] Analyze Git Changes:

   Requirement: Determine all files that have changed since last commit
   Actions:
   - Execute: `git status --porcelain` to identify modified files
   - Execute: `git diff --name-only HEAD` to list changed file paths
   - Categorize: Count Python files, test files, documents, SPEC files separately
     WHY: Git state determines synchronization scope and impact analysis
     IMPACT: Incomplete Git analysis leads to partial synchronization

2. [HARD] Read Project Configuration:

   Requirement: Load essential project settings from configuration file
   Actions:
   - Read: `.moai/config.yaml` file
   - Extract: `git_strategy.mode` value (must be Personal or Team)
   - Extract: `language.conversation_language` value (determines document language)
   - Extract: `git_strategy.spec_git_workflow` value
     WHY: Configuration drives workflow behavior and language output
     IMPACT: Missing configuration values cause workflow misalignment and language errors

3. [HARD] Determine Synchronization Mode:

   Requirement: Parse arguments to establish execution mode
   Actions:
   - Parse $ARGUMENTS for mode value: must be one of auto, force, status, or project
   - If empty: Default to auto mode
   - Parse optional flags: --auto-merge, --skip-pre-check, --skip-quality-check
   - Parse special flags: --worktree, --branch
     WHY: Mode determines scope and processing strategy
     IMPACT: Invalid mode selection produces incorrect synchronization behavior

4. [SOFT] Handle Worktree Detection:

   Requirement: Identify if execution occurs within a Git worktree
   Actions:
   - Execute: `git rev-parse --git-dir` to locate git directory
   - Analyze: Check if git directory path contains `worktrees/` component
   - If in worktree: Extract SPEC ID from current path (format: SPEC-{DOMAIN}-{NUMBER})
   - Alternative: Check worktree registry at `~/worktrees/{PROJECT_NAME}/.moai-worktree-registry.json`
   - Store: `$WORKTREE_MODE=true` and `$CURRENT_SPEC_ID` for later use
     WHY: Worktree context enables specialized cleanup and workflow options
     IMPACT: Missing worktree detection prevents proper exit handling but does not block sync

5. [SOFT] Handle Branch Detection:

   Requirement: Identify if execution occurs on feature branch
   Actions:
   - Check: Is --branch flag present in arguments OR is current branch not main
   - Execute: `git branch --show-current` to get current branch name
   - Store: `$BRANCH_MODE=true` and `$CURRENT_BRANCH` for later use
     WHY: Branch context enables proper merge and cleanup operations
     IMPACT: Missing branch detection reduces workflow automation but does not prevent sync

6. [HARD] Handle Status Mode Early Exit:

   Requirement: For status mode, provide quick health report and exit
   Actions:
   - Check: If mode is status value
   - Report: Current project health assessment
   - Report: Count of changed files
   - Report: Synchronization recommendation
   - If status mode: Execute Phase 0.5 quality verification before reporting
   - Exit: Command completes with success code (no further phases)
     WHY: Status mode serves quick health check without making changes, but still validates project quality
     IMPACT: Skipping quality check in status mode reduces visibility of project health

Result: Project context gathered. Synchronization mode established. Ready for quality verification (Phase 0.5).

---

### Step 1.2.5: Phase 0.5 Quality Verification

[HARD] Execute quality verification pipeline before document synchronization begins.

WHY: Quality checks prevent synchronizing broken states. Early validation catches issues before expensive document updates.
IMPACT: Skipping quality checks risks propagating issues to documentation.

Quality Verification Pipeline:

This phase automatically detects the project language and runs appropriate quality tools:

```
Detect Project Language
    ↓
Language-specific tool execution (PARALLEL)
    ┌── Test Runner (pytest/jest/go test/cargo test/etc.)
    ├── Linter (ruff/eslint/golangci-lint/clippy/etc.)
    └── Type Checker (mypy/tsc/go vet/etc.)
    ↓
Result Collection & Aggregation
    ↓
code-review invocation (manager-quality)
    ↓
Quality Report
```

### Parallel Quality Verification Implementation

After language detection, execute test runner, linter, and type checker simultaneously:

Step 1 - Launch Background Tasks:

1. Test Runner: Use Bash tool with run_in_background set to true for language-specific test command
2. Linter: Use Bash tool with run_in_background set to true for language-specific lint command
3. Type Checker: Use Bash tool with run_in_background set to true for language-specific type check command

Step 2 - Collect Results:

1. Use TaskOutput tool to collect results from all three background tasks
2. Wait for all tasks to complete (timeout: 180 seconds per task for test runner, 120 seconds for others)
3. Handle partial failures gracefully - continue with available results

Step 3 - Aggregate Results:

1. Parse output from each tool into structured result
2. Determine status for each tool: PASS, FAIL, WARN, SKIP
3. If test runner has failures: Prompt user via AskUserQuestion before proceeding

Step 4 - Proceed to Code Review:

1. Pass aggregated results to manager-quality
2. Generate comprehensive quality report

WHY: Parallel execution reduces Phase 0.5 time from 60-90 seconds to 20-40 seconds (2-3x speedup)
IMPACT: Significantly faster quality verification without sacrificing thoroughness

---

#### Task 1.2.5.6: Generate Quality Report

After all checks complete, generate comprehensive quality report:

1. Create quality report output:

   ```
   Phase 0.5 Quality Verification Results
   =====================================

   Project Language: [detected_language]

   Tool Verification Results:
   test-runner:  [PASS|FAIL|WARN|SKIP] ([tool_name])
   linter:       [PASS|FAIL|WARN|SKIP] ([tool_name])
   type-checker: [PASS|FAIL|WARN|SKIP] ([tool_name])
   code-review:  [PASS|WARN]

   Details:
   - test-runner: [summary]
   - linter: [summary]
   - type-checker: [summary]
   - code-review: [summary]

   Overall Status: [PASS|WARN]

   Next Step: Proceeding to document synchronization
   ```

2. Store report:
   - Save complete report in QUALITY_REPORT
   - Print summary to user

3. Determine phase outcome:
   - IF test runner user chose "Abort": Go to PHASE 4 (exit)
   - IF all checks complete: Continue to Step 1.3

Result: Quality verification complete. All issues documented. Ready for project status verification.

---

### Step 1.3: Project Status Verification

[HARD] Your task: Verify project status across entire project.

[HARD] Required Scope: Scan ALL source files, not just changed files.
WHY: Partial scans miss issues in unmodified sections. Comprehensive scanning ensures quality gates pass.

Verification Requirements:

- Project integrity assessment (identify broken references, inconsistencies)
- Complete issues detection with precise locations
- Resolution recommendations for discovered issues

Output Requirements:

- Complete issue list with file locations and line numbers
- Project integrity status: Healthy or Issues Detected
- Severity classification for each issue: Critical, High, Medium, Low

Storage:

- Store complete response in `$PROJECT_VALIDATION_RESULTS`
- Format must be machine-parseable for downstream agent processing

WHY: Complete validation prevents synchronization of broken states. Detailed results enable targeted fixes.

---

### Step 1.4: Invoke Doc-Syncer for Synchronization Plan

[SOFT] Apply --ultrathink keyword for synchronization strategy analysis
WHY: Sync planning requires understanding of project state, changed files, and appropriate mode selection
IMPACT: Sequential thinking ensures optimal synchronization approach and quality validation

Your task: Call manager-docs to analyze Git changes and create synchronization strategy.

Use the manager-docs subagent to:

Establish a document synchronization plan

Critical Language Configuration:

- Receive instructions in agent_prompt_language from config (default: English)
- Respond in conversation_language from config (user's preferred language)
- Example: If agent_prompt_language="en" and conversation_language="ko", receive English instructions but respond in Korean

Task Instructions:

- Analyze Git changes and create a synchronization plan
- Synchronization mode: [auto/force/status/project]
- Changed files: [from git diff]
- Project verification results: [from analysis]

Required output:

1. Summary of documents to update
2. SPEC documents requiring synchronization
3. Project improvements needed
4. Estimated work scope

Ensure all document updates align with conversation_language setting.

Store: Response in `$SYNC_PLAN`

---

### Step 1.5: Request User Approval

Present synchronization plan and get user decision:

1. Display comprehensive plan report:

   ```
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    Document Synchronization Plan Report
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

    Project Analysis:
   - Mode: [mode]
   - Scope: [scope]
   - Changed files: [count]
   - Project mode: [Personal/Team]

    Synchronization Strategy:
   - Living Documents: [list]
   - SPEC documents: [list]
   - Project improvements needed: [count]

    Project Status:
   - Project integrity: [Healthy / Issues]
   - Project issues: [count]
   - Broken references: [count]

   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   ```

2. Ask for user approval using AskUserQuestion:
   - `question`: "Synchronization plan is ready. How would you like to proceed?"
   - `header`: "Plan Approval"
   - `multiSelect`: false
   - `options`: 4 choices:
     1. "Proceed with Sync" → Execute synchronization
     2. "Request Modifications" → Modify strategy
     3. "Review Details" → See full project results
     4. "Abort" → Cancel (no changes made)

3. Process user response:
   - IF "Proceed" → Go to PHASE 2
   - IF "Modifications" → Ask for changes, re-run PHASE 1
   - IF "Review Details" → Show project results, re-ask approval
   - IF "Abort" → Go to PHASE 4 (graceful exit)

Result: User decision captured. Command proceeds or exits.

---

## PHASE 2: Execute Document Synchronization

Goal: Synchronize documents with code changes, update SPECs, verify quality.

### Step 2.1: Create Safety Backup

[HARD] Create safety backup before any modifications begin:

[HARD] Backup Creation Must Complete Successfully:
WHY: Backups enable rollback if synchronization fails or produces unexpected results
IMPACT: Missing backup eliminates recovery option if sync produces errors

1. [HARD] Generate Timestamp for Backup Identity:

   Requirement: Create unique timestamp identifier for backup
   Action: Execute `date +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S` and store result in `$TIMESTAMP`
   WHY: Timestamp enables multiple backups without overwriting previous ones

2. [HARD] Create Backup Directory:

   Requirement: Establish isolated directory for backup files
   Action: Execute `mkdir -p .moai-backups/sync-$TIMESTAMP/`
   WHY: Isolated directory prevents mixing backup versions

3. [HARD] Backup All Critical Project Files:

   Requirement: Copy all essential project files to backup
   Files to backup:
   - README.md (if exists) - Project documentation
   - docs/ directory (if exists) - Additional documentation
   - .moai/specs/ directory - SPEC definitions
     WHY: Backing up all critical files enables complete state restoration

4. [HARD] Verify Backup Integrity:

   Requirement: Confirm backup was created successfully
   Actions:
   - Execute: `ls -la .moai-backups/sync-$TIMESTAMP/`
   - Verify: Backup directory is not empty
   - If empty: Print error message and exit with failure code
   - If complete: Print success message and continue
     WHY: Verification confirms backup is usable for recovery

Result: Safety backup created and verified. Ready for synchronization phase.

---

### Step 2.2: Invoke Doc-Syncer for Document Synchronization

Your task: Call manager-docs to execute the approved synchronization plan.

Use the manager-docs subagent to:

Execute Living Document synchronization

Critical Language Configuration:

- Receive instructions in agent_prompt_language from config (default: English)
- Respond in conversation_language from config (user's preferred language)
- Example: If agent_prompt_language="en" and conversation_language="ko", receive English instructions but respond in Korean

Execute the approved synchronization plan:

Previous analysis results:

- Project verification: [from analysis]
- Synchronization strategy: [from manager-docs analysis]

Task Instructions:

1. Living Document synchronization:
   - Reflect changed code in documentation
   - Auto-generate/update API documentation
   - Update README (if needed)
   - Synchronize Architecture documents

2. Project improvements:
   - Fix project issues (if possible)
   - Restore broken references

3. SPEC synchronization:
   - Ensure SPEC documents match implementation
   - Update EARS statements if needed

4. Domain-based documentation:
   - Detect changed domains (frontend/backend/devops/database/ml/mobile)
   - Generate domain-specific documentation updates

5. Generate synchronization report:
   - File location: .moai/reports/sync-report-$TIMESTAMP.md
   - Include: Updated file list, Project improvements, results summary

Important: Use conversation_language for all document updates.

Execute the plan precisely and report results in detail.

Store: Response in `$SYNC_RESULTS`

---

### Step 2.3: Invoke Quality-Gate for Verification

Your task: Call manager-quality to verify synchronization quality.

Use the manager-quality subagent to:

Verify document synchronization quality

Critical Language Configuration:

- Receive instructions in agent_prompt_language from config (default: English)
- Respond in conversation_language from config (user's preferred language)
- Example: If agent_prompt_language="en" and conversation_language="ko", receive English instructions but respond in Korean

Task: Verify that document synchronization meets TRUST 5 principles.

Verification checks:

1. Test First: Are all project links complete?
2. Readable: Are documents well-formatted?
3. Unified: Are all documents consistent?
4. Secured: Are no credentials exposed?
5. Trackable: Are all SPECs properly linked?

Output: PASS / FAIL with details

Result: Quality verification complete.

---

### Step 2.4: Update SPEC Status to Completed

After successful synchronization, update SPEC status to completed:

1. Batch update all completed SPECs:

   ```bash
   python3 .claude/hooks/moai/spec_status_hooks.py batch_update
   ```

2. Verify status updates:
   - Check results from batch update
   - Record version changes and status transitions
   - Include status changes in sync report

3. Handle individual SPEC validation (if needed):

   ```bash
   python3 .claude/hooks/moai/spec_status_hooks.py validate_completion <SPEC_ID>
   python3 .claude/hooks/moai/spec_status_hooks.py status_update <SPEC_ID> --status completed --reason "Documentation synchronized successfully"
   ```

4. Generate status update summary:
   - Count of SPECs updated to completed
   - List of any failed updates with reasons
   - Version changes for each SPEC
   - Integration with sync report

Integration: Status updates are included in the Git commit from Phase 3 with detailed commit message.

---

## PHASE 3: Git Operations & PR

Goal: Commit changes, transition PR (if Team mode), optionally auto-merge.

### Step 3.1: Invoke Git-Manager for Commit

Your task: Call manager-git to commit all document changes.

Use the manager-git subagent to:

Commit document synchronization changes to Git

Critical Language Configuration:

- Receive instructions in agent_prompt_language from config (default: English)
- Respond in conversation_language from config (user's preferred language)
- Example: If agent_prompt_language="en" and conversation_language="ko", receive English instructions but respond in Korean

Task: Commit document synchronization changes to Git.

Commit Scope:

- All changed document files
- .moai/reports/ directory
- README.md (if changed)
- docs/ directory (if changed)

Commit Message Template:

```
docs: sync documentation with code changes

Synchronized Living Documents:
- [list from synchronization results]

Project updates:
- [count] repairs completed
- SPEC index updated

SPEC synchronization:
- [count] SPECs updated

Domain-specific sync:
- [domain list if applicable]

Generated with Claude Code
```

Important:

- Bundle all changes into a single commit
- Report success after commit

Execution Order:

1. git add (changed document files)
2. git commit -m (commit message above)
3. git log -1 (verify commit)

Verify:

- Execute: `git log -1 --oneline`
- Print commit info
- IF commit failed → Exit with error code

---

### Step 3.2: (Optional) PR Ready Transition

For Team mode projects only:

1. Check if Team mode:
   - Read: `git_strategy.mode` from config
   - IF Personal → Skip to next phase

2. Transition PR to Ready:
   - Use Task tool:
     - `subagent_type`: "manager-git"
     - `description`: "Transition PR to Ready for Review"
     - `prompt`: "Transition PR from Draft to Ready. Execute: `gh pr ready`"

3. Assign reviewers and labels (if configured)

---

### Step 3.3: (Optional) PR Auto-Merge

If `--auto-merge` flag is set:

1. Check CI/CD status:
   - Execute: `gh pr checks`
   - IF failing → Print warning and skip merge

2. Check merge conflicts:
   - Execute: `gh pr view --json mergeable`
   - IF conflicts exist → Print warning and skip merge

3. Execute auto-merge:
   - Execute: `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch`

4. Branch cleanup:
   - Checkout: `git checkout develop`
   - Pull: `git pull origin develop`
   - Delete local branch if merge succeeded

---

## PHASE 4: Completion & Next Steps

Goal: Report results and guide user to next action.

### Step 4.1: Display Completion Report

Print comprehensive summary:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 Document Synchronization Complete
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

 Synchronization Summary:
- Mode: [mode]
- Scope: [scope]
- Files updated: [count]
- Files created: [count]
- Project improvements: [count]

 Documents Updated:
- Living Documents: [list]
- SPEC documents: [list]
- Domain-specific reports: [count]

 Project Status:
- Project integrity: [PASS / WARNING]

 Reports Generated:
- Master sync report: .moai/reports/sync-report-$TIMESTAMP.md
- Domain reports: [list if any]

 Backup Location:
- Safety backup: .moai-backups/sync-$TIMESTAMP/

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

---

### Step 4.2: Handle Worktree/Branch Workflow Options

If $WORKTREE_MODE is true:

After sync completion, provide worktree-specific options:

1. Ask for worktree next action:

   ```python
   AskUserQuestion({
       "questions": [{
           "question": f"Worktree synchronization for {CURRENT_SPEC_ID} is complete. What would you like to do?",
           "header": "Worktree Next Steps",
           "multiSelect": false,
           "options": [
               {
                   "label": "Return to Main Directory",
                   "description": "Exit worktree and return to main project directory"
               },
               {
                   "label": "Continue in Worktree",
                   "description": "Stay in current worktree for continued development"
               },
               {
                   "label": "Switch to Another Worktree",
                   "description": "Navigate to a different SPEC worktree"
               },
               {
                   "label": "Remove This Worktree",
                   "description": "Clean up and remove the current worktree"
               }
           ]
       }]
   })
   ```

2. Execute user choice:
   - IF "Return to Main Directory" → Execute: `cd ~/MoAI/MoAI-ADK`
   - IF "Continue in Worktree" → Stay in current directory
   - IF "Switch to Another Worktree" → List available worktrees and facilitate switch
   - IF "Remove This Worktree" → Execute: `moai-worktree remove {CURRENT_SPEC_ID}` then return to main

If $BRANCH_MODE is true:

After sync completion, provide branch-specific options:

1. Ask for branch next action:

   ```python
   AskUserQuestion({
       "questions": [{
           "question": f"Branch synchronization for {CURRENT_BRANCH} is complete. What would you like to do?",
           "header": "Branch Next Steps",
           "multiSelect": false,
           "options": [
               {
                   "label": "Commit and Push Changes",
                   "description": "Commit sync changes and push to remote branch"
               },
               {
                   "label": "Return to Main Branch",
                   "description": "Switch back to main branch without pushing"
               },
               {
                   "label": "Create Pull Request",
                   "description": "Create PR for this branch and return to main"
               },
               {
                   "label": "Continue on Branch",
                   "description": "Stay on current branch for continued development"
               }
           ]
       }]
   })
   ```

2. Execute user choice:
   - IF "Commit and Push Changes" → Execute: `git add . && git commit && git push origin {CURRENT_BRANCH}`
   - IF "Return to Main Branch" → Execute: `git checkout main` (warn about uncommitted changes)
   - IF "Create Pull Request" → Execute: `gh pr create` then checkout main
   - IF "Continue on Branch" → Stay on current branch

### Step 4.3: Standard Next Steps (Non-Worktree/Branch Mode)

Use AskUserQuestion to guide next steps:

- `question`: "Documentation synchronization complete. What would you like to do next?"
- `header`: "Next Steps"
- `multiSelect`: false
- `options`: 3-4 choices depending on context:
  - " Create Next SPEC" → /moai:1-plan
  - " Start New Session" → /clear for fresh context
  - "📤 Review PR" (Team mode) → gh pr view --web
  - " Continue Development" (Personal mode)
  - " Project Overview" → Review reports and docs

---

## Graceful Exit (User Aborts)

If user chooses to abort in PHASE 1:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 Synchronization Aborted
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

No changes were made to:
- Documents
- Git history
- Branch state

Your project remains in its current state.

You can retry synchronization anytime with:
/moai:3-sync [mode]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

Exit command with code 0.

    "questions": [{
        "question": "Documentation synchronization is complete. What would you like to do next?",
        "header": "Next Steps",
        "multiSelect": false,
        "options": [
            {
                "label": "Develop New Feature",
                "description": "Execute /moai:1-plan to plan new feature"
            },
            {
                "label": "Process PR Merge",
                "description": "Review and merge Pull Request"
            },
            {
                "label": "Complete Workflow",
                "description": "Complete current work and clean up session"
            }
        ]
    }]
})
```

Important:

- Use conversation language from config

- Always provide clear next step options

## EXECUTION DIRECTIVE

You must NOW execute the command following the "OVERALL WORKFLOW STRUCTURE" described above.

1. Start PHASE 1: Analysis & Planning immediately.
2. Use the manager-docs subagent (or appropriate subagent for the step).
3. Do NOT just describe what you will do. DO IT.
