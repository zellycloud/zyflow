# MoAI-ADK Step 1: Establish a plan (Plan) - Always make a plan first and then proceed

User Interaction Architecture: AskUserQuestion must be used at COMMAND level only. Subagents invoked via Task() operate in isolated, stateless contexts and cannot interact with users. Collect all user input BEFORE delegating to agents.

[HARD] AskUserQuestion Mandatory Usage:

Requirement: All user decisions MUST be collected via AskUserQuestion tool before proceeding
WHY: Ensures explicit user consent and prevents unintended actions
IMPACT: Skipping AskUserQuestion causes unpredictable behavior and user confusion

Mandatory Decision Points:

1. SPEC Creation Approval: Ask before creating SPEC files (Step 1B.2)
2. Development Environment Selection: Ask for worktree/branch/current choice (Step 2.2)
3. Next Action Selection: Ask after SPEC creation completes (Final Step)

Batched Design: All AskUserQuestion calls follow batched design principles (1-4 questions per call, max 4 options per question) to minimize user interaction turns. See CLAUDE.md section "User Interaction Architecture" for details.

4-Step Workflow Integration: This command implements Steps 1-2 of Alfred's workflow (Intent Understanding → Plan Creation). See CLAUDE.md for full workflow details.

## Command Purpose

"Plan → Run → Sync" As the first step in the workflow, it supports the entire planning process from ideation to plan creation.

Plan for: $ARGUMENTS

### Usage Scenarios (3 Execution Patterns)

Scenario 1: SPEC Only (Default)

- Command: /moai:1-plan "User authentication system"
- Creates SPEC documents only
- Follows existing branch creation logic

Scenario 2: SPEC + Branch (Legacy)

- Command: /moai:1-plan "User authentication system" --branch
- Creates SPEC documents plus Git branch
- Traditional feature branch workflow

Scenario 3: SPEC + Worktree (NEW)

- Command: /moai:1-plan "User authentication system" --worktree
- Creates SPEC documents plus Git worktree
- Isolated development environment for parallel SPEC work
- Displays guidance messages for worktree navigation

Flag Priority: --worktree takes precedence over --branch, which takes precedence over default (SPEC only)

---

## Associated Agents and Skills

Associated Agents for SPEC Planning and Creation:

- Explore: Codebase exploration and file system analysis
  WHY: Fast, focused discovery without blocking agent
  IMPACT: Reduces manual project discovery time

- manager-spec: SPEC generation in EARS format and planning
  WHY: Specialized domain knowledge for structured requirements
  IMPACT: Ensures consistent SPEC document quality

- manager-git: Git workflow and branch management
  WHY: Encapsulates git operations with proper error handling
  IMPACT: Prevents manual git errors and ensures consistency

### Agent Delegation Strategy

Phase 1A: Research & Analysis

- Use built-in Explore agent for fast codebase analysis (read-only)
- Use Plan agent (auto-invoked in plan mode) for SPEC research
- Use MoAI manager-spec agent for SPEC generation

Phase 1B: Specialized Analysis

- Use MoAI domain agents (expert-backend, expert-database, etc.) for specialized decisions
- Use mcp-context7 for API documentation research
- Use mcp-sequential-thinking for complex architectural decisions

---

## Agent Invocation Patterns (CLAUDE.md Compliance)

[HARD] AGENT DELEGATION MANDATE:

- ALL planning tasks MUST be delegated to specialized agents (Explore, manager-spec, manager-git)
- NEVER execute planning or SPEC creation directly, even after auto compact
- WHY: Specialized agents have domain expertise for EARS format, Git workflow, and codebase analysis
- This rule applies regardless of session state or context recovery

This command uses agent execution patterns defined in CLAUDE.md (lines 96-120).

### Sequential Phase-Based Chaining PASS

Command implements sequential chaining through 4 distinct phases:

Phase Flow:

- Phase 1A (Optional): Project Exploration via Explore subagent
- Phase 1B (Required): SPEC Planning via manager-spec subagent
- Phase 2: SPEC Document Creation via manager-spec subagent
- Phase 3: Git Branch Setup via manager-git subagent (conditional)

Each phase receives context and outputs from previous phases.

WHY: Sequential execution ensures proper dependency management

- Phase 1B needs exploration results from 1A (if applicable)
- Phase 2 requires approved plan from Phase 1B
- Phase 3 depends on created SPEC files from Phase 2

IMPACT: Skipping phases or parallel execution would violate dependencies and create incomplete specifications

### Parallel Execution FAIL

Not applicable - phases have explicit dependencies

WHY: Each phase depends on outputs from previous phase

- Cannot create SPEC documents before plan approval
- Cannot create git branch before SPEC files exist

IMPACT: Parallel execution would cause file system inconsistencies and incomplete workflows

### Resumable Agent Support PASS

Command supports resume pattern for draft SPECs:

Resume Command:

- `/moai:1-plan resume SPEC-XXX`
- Continues from last saved draft state
- Preserves user input and planning context

WHY: Complex planning sessions may require multiple iterations
IMPACT: Resume capability prevents loss of planning work and enables iterative refinement

---

Refer to CLAUDE.md "Agent Chaining Patterns" (lines 96-120) for complete pattern architecture.

---

## Execution Philosophy: "Always make a plan first and then proceed."

/moai:1-plan performs SPEC planning through complete agent delegation:

Execution Flow:

- User Command: /moai:1-plan "description"
- /moai:1-plan Command delegates to Task with subagent_type set to Explore or manager-spec
  - Phase 1A (Optional): Project Exploration
  - Phase 1B (Required): SPEC Planning
  - Phase 2: SPEC Document Creation
  - Phase 3: Git Branch and PR Setup
- Output: SPEC documents plus branch (conditional) plus next steps

### Tool Usage Guidelines

This command has access to all tools for flexibility:

- Task() for agent orchestration (recommended for complex tasks)
- AskUserQuestion() for user interaction at command level
- Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep for direct operations when needed

Agent delegation is recommended for complex tasks that benefit from specialized expertise. Direct tool usage is permitted when appropriate for simpler operations.

---

## The 4-Step Agent-Based Workflow Command Logic (v5.0.0)

This command implements the first 2 steps of Alfred's 4-step workflow:

1. STEP 1: Intent Understanding (Clarify user requirements)
2. STEP 2: Plan Creation (Create execution strategy with agent delegation)
3. STEP 3: Task Execution (Execute via manager-ddd - NOT in this command)
4. STEP 4: Report & Commit (Documentation and git operations - NOT in this command)

Command Scope: Only executes Steps 1-2. Steps 3-4 are executed by `/moai:2-run` and `/moai:3-sync`.

---

## The Command Has THREE Execution Phases

1. PHASE 1: Project Analysis & SPEC Planning (STEP 1)
2. PHASE 2: SPEC Document Creation (STEP 2)
3. PHASE 3: Git Branch & PR Setup (STEP 2 continuation)

Each phase contains explicit step-by-step instructions.

---

## PHASE 1: Project Analysis and SPEC Planning (STEP 1)

PHASE 1 consists of two independent sub-phases to provide flexible workflow based on user request clarity:

### PHASE 1 Workflow Overview

PHASE 1 Structure:

Phase A (OPTIONAL) - Explore Agent:

- Find relevant files by keywords
- Locate existing SPEC documents
- Identify implementation patterns
- Output: Exploration results passed to Phase B

Phase B (REQUIRED) - manager-spec Agent:

- Analyze project documents
- Propose SPEC candidates
- Design EARS structure
- Request user approval

After Phase B: Progress Report and User Confirmation

- Display analysis results and plan summary
- Show next steps and deliverables
- Request final user approval
- Proceed to PHASE 2

Key Points:

- Phase A is optional - Skip if user provides clear SPEC title
- Phase B is required - Always runs to analyze project and create SPEC

---

### PHASE 1A: Project Exploration (Optional - if needed)

#### When to run Phase A

This phase executes conditionally based on request clarity:

- [SOFT] User provides only vague/unstructured request
  WHY: Vague requests require exploration to identify relevant context
  IMPACT: Skipping exploration for vague requests produces unfocused SPECs

- [SOFT] Need to find existing files and patterns
  WHY: Discovery prevents duplicate work and informs architecture decisions
  IMPACT: Missing patterns leads to inconsistent implementation approaches

- [SOFT] Unclear about current project state
  WHY: Project context shapes technical constraints and dependencies
  IMPACT: Uninformed SPECs fail to account for existing architecture

#### Step 1A.1: Invoke Explore Agent (Optional)

Conditional Execution: Run Phase A ONLY if user request lacks clarity

If user request is vague or needs exploration:

Use the Explore subagent to:

Analyze the current project directory structure and relevant files based on the user request: "$ARGUMENTS"

Tasks:

1. Find relevant files by keywords from the user request
2. Locate existing SPEC documents (.moai/specs/\*.md)
3. Identify implementation patterns and dependencies
4. Discover project configuration files
5. Analyze existing codebase structure

Report back:

- List of relevant files found
- Existing SPEC candidates discovered
- Implementation patterns identified
- Technical constraints and dependencies
- Recommendations for user clarification

Return comprehensive results to guide manager-spec agent.

Phase 1A Completion:

- Log exploration completion status
- Proceed to Phase 1B with exploration context

Else (user provided clear SPEC title):

- Skip Phase A
- Log Phase 1A as skipped
- Proceed directly to Phase 1B

Decision Logic: If user provided clear SPEC title (like "Add authentication module"), skip Phase A entirely and proceed directly to Phase B.

---

### PHASE 1B: SPEC Planning (Required)

#### Step 1B.1: Invoke manager-spec for project analysis

[SOFT] Apply --ultrathink keyword for deep architectural analysis
WHY: SPEC planning requires careful consideration of domain classification, technical constraints, and dependency analysis
IMPACT: Sequential thinking ensures comprehensive requirement analysis and proper EARS structure design

Use the manager-spec subagent to:

Analyze project and create SPEC plan for: $ARGUMENTS

Context Handling:

- If Phase 1A was executed: Continue from project exploration results
- If Phase 1A was skipped: Start fresh analysis based on user request: "$ARGUMENTS"

Language Configuration:

- conversation_language: {{CONVERSATION_LANGUAGE}}
- language_name: {{CONVERSATION_LANGUAGE_NAME}}

Critical Language Rules:

- Receive instructions in agent_prompt_language from config (default: English)
- Respond in conversation_language from config (user's preferred language)
- All SPEC documents content must be written in {{CONVERSATION_LANGUAGE}}
- Code examples and technical keywords remain in English (global standard)

Task Instructions:

PHASE 1B.1: Project Analysis and SPEC Discovery

1. Document Analysis: Scan for existing documentation and patterns
   - Product document: Find relevant files
   - Structure document: Identify architectural patterns
   - Tech document: Discover technical constraints

2. SPEC Candidate Generation: Create 1-3 SPEC candidates
   - Analyze existing SPECs in `.moai/specs/` for duplicates
   - Check related GitHub issues via appropriate tools
   - Generate unique SPEC candidates with proper naming

3. EARS Structure Design: For each SPEC candidate:
   - Define clear requirements using EARS grammar
   - Design acceptance criteria with Given/When/Then
   - Identify technical dependencies and constraints

PHASE 1B.2: Implementation Plan Creation
For the selected SPEC candidate, create a comprehensive implementation plan:

Technical Constraints & Dependencies:

- Library versions: Find latest stable versions
- Specify exact versions (e.g., `fastapi>=0.118.3`)
- Exclude beta/alpha versions, select only production stable versions
- Note: Detailed versions finalized in `/moai:2-run` stage

Precautions:

- Technical constraints: [Restraints to consider]
- Dependency: [Relevance with other SPECs]
- Branch strategy: [Processing by Personal/Team mode]

Expected deliverables:

- spec.md: [Core specifications of the EARS structure]
- plan.md: [Implementation plan]
- acceptance.md: [Acceptance criteria]
- Branches/PR: [Git operations by mode]

Phase 1B Completion:

- Log planning completion status
- Store context for subsequent phases

#### Step 1B.2: Request user approval

After the manager-spec presents the implementation plan report, use AskUserQuestion tool for explicit approval:

Tool: AskUserQuestion
Parameters:
questions:

- question: "Planning is complete. Would you like to proceed with SPEC creation based on this plan?"
  header: "SPEC Generation"
  multiSelect: false
  options:
  - label: "Proceed with SPEC Creation"
    description: "Create SPEC files in .moai/specs/SPEC-{ID}/ based on approved plan"
  - label: "Request Plan Modification"
    description: "Modify plan content before SPEC creation"
  - label: "Save as Draft"
    description: "Save plan as draft and continue later"
  - label: "Cancel"
    description: "Discard plan and return to planning stage"

After AskUserQuestion returns user selection, proceed to Step 3.5.

#### Step 3.5: Progress Report and User Confirmation

This step automatically executes after PHASE 1 completion.

Display detailed progress report to user and get final approval:

Progress Report for PHASE 1 Completion:

Completed Items:

- Project document analysis completed
- Existing SPEC scan completed
- SPEC candidate generation completed
- Technical constraint analysis completed

Plan Summary:

- Selected SPEC: [SPEC ID] - [SPEC Title]
- Priority: [Priority value]
- Main technology stack: [Technology Stack]

Next Phase Plan (PHASE 2):

- spec.md creation: Core specifications with EARS structure
- plan.md creation: Detailed implementation plan
- acceptance.md creation: Acceptance criteria and scenarios
- Directory: .moai/specs/SPEC-[ID]/

Important Notes:

- Existing files may be overwritten
- Dependencies: [Dependencies list]
- Resource requirements: [Resource Requirements]

Tool: AskUserQuestion
Parameters:
questions:

- question: "Plan completion and progress report\n\nAnalysis results:\n- SPEC candidates found: [Number]\n- Priority: [Priority]\n- Estimated work time: [Time Estimation]\n\nNext steps:\n1. PHASE 2: SPEC file creation\n - .moai/specs/SPEC-{ID}/\n - spec.md, plan.md, acceptance.md creation\n\nProceed with the plan?"
  header: "Plan Confirmation"
  multiSelect: false
  options:
  - label: "Proceed"
    description: "Start SPEC creation according to plan"
  - label: "Detailed Revision"
    description: "Revise plan content then proceed"
  - label: "Save as Draft"
    description: "Save plan and continue later"
  - label: "Cancel"
    description: "Cancel operation and discard plan"

Process user response from AskUserQuestion in Step 4.

#### Step 4: Process user's answer

Based on the user's choice:

IF user selected "Proceed":

1. Store approval confirmation
2. Print: Plan approved. Proceeding to PHASE 2.
3. Proceed to PHASE 2 (SPEC Document Creation)

IF user selected "Detailed Revision":

1. Ask the user: "What changes would you like to make to the plan?"
2. Collect user's feedback via AskUserQuestion
3. Pass feedback to manager-spec agent
4. manager-spec updates the plan
5. Return to Step 3.5 (request approval again with updated plan)

IF user selected "Save as Draft":

1. Create directory: `.moai/specs/SPEC-{ID}/`
2. Save plan to `.moai/specs/SPEC-{ID}/plan.md` with status: draft
3. Create commit: `draft(spec): WIP SPEC-{ID} - {title}`
4. Print to user: "Draft saved. Resume with: `/moai:1-plan resume SPEC-{ID}`"
5. End command execution (stop here)

IF user selected "Cancel":

1. Print to user: "Plan discarded. No files created."
2. End command execution (stop here)

---

## PHASE 1.5: Pre-Creation Validation Gate (NEW)

This phase executes BEFORE PHASE 2 to prevent common SPEC creation errors.

### Step 1.5.1: SPEC Type Classification

Before creating any document, classify the requested content type:

[HARD] Document Type Classification Requirement:

Requirement: Determine if the request is for a SPEC, Report, or Documentation
WHY: Misclassified documents cause organizational chaos and discovery failures
IMPACT: Reports in SPEC directories break automated SPEC scanning and workflow integration

Classification Algorithm:

Step 1: Detect Keywords in User Request

Report Keywords (route to .moai/reports/):

- "report", "analysis", "assessment", "audit", "review", "evaluation"
- "retrospective", "post-mortem", "findings", "recommendations"
- "summary", "overview", "status", "progress"
- Korean: "보고서", "분석", "평가", "리뷰", "검토", "요약", "현황"
- Japanese: "レポート", "分析", "評価", "レビュー", "概要"

SPEC Keywords (route to .moai/specs/):

- "feature", "requirement", "implementation", "functionality"
- "user story", "acceptance criteria", "EARS", "specification"
- "add", "create", "implement", "build", "develop"
- Korean: "기능", "요구사항", "구현", "스펙", "개발"
- Japanese: "機能", "要件", "実装", "スペック", "開発"

Documentation Keywords (route to .moai/docs/):

- "documentation", "guide", "manual", "reference", "tutorial"
- "README", "API docs", "changelog"
- Korean: "문서", "가이드", "매뉴얼", "참조"
- Japanese: "ドキュメント", "ガイド", "マニュアル"

Step 2: Apply Classification Rules

IF report_keywords detected AND NOT spec_keywords:

- Route to: `.moai/reports/{REPORT-TYPE}/`
- Example: `.moai/reports/security-audit-2025-01/`
- DO NOT create in .moai/specs/

ELSE IF documentation_keywords detected AND NOT spec_keywords:

- Route to: `.moai/docs/`
- Example: `.moai/docs/api-reference.md`
- DO NOT create in .moai/specs/

ELSE:

- Route to: `.moai/specs/SPEC-{DOMAIN}-{NUMBER}/`
- Continue to Step 1.5.2

### Step 1.5.2: Pre-Creation Validation Checklist

[HARD] Pre-Creation Validation Requirement:

Before creating ANY SPEC directory or file, complete ALL of these checks:

Check 1: ID Format Validation

- Pattern: `SPEC-{DOMAIN}-{NUMBER}`
- DOMAIN: Uppercase letters only (AUTH, API, UI, DB, etc.)
- NUMBER: 3-digit zero-padded number (001, 002, etc.)
- Valid: `SPEC-AUTH-001`, `SPEC-API-002`, `SPEC-UI-003`
- Invalid: `SPEC-001`, `AUTH-001`, `SPEC-auth-001`, `SPEC-AUTH-1`
- WHY: Consistent format enables automated scanning and sorting
- IMPACT: Invalid format breaks tooling and discovery

Check 2: Domain Name Validation

- Use ONLY domains from the Allowed Domain Names list (Step 1.5.3)
- Maximum 2 domains in composite names (e.g., `UPDATE-REFACTOR`)
- WHY: Standardized domains enable cross-project consistency
- IMPACT: Random domains cause categorization failures

Check 3: ID Uniqueness Verification

- Execute: `find .moai/specs -name "SPEC-{DOMAIN}-{NUMBER}" -type d`
- If found: Increment number (001 → 002) or modify domain
- WHY: Duplicate IDs cause version conflicts
- IMPACT: Duplicate SPECs create implementation ambiguity

Check 4: Directory Structure Enforcement

- MUST create directory: `.moai/specs/SPEC-{DOMAIN}-{NUMBER}/`
- MUST create all 3 files: `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `acceptance.md`
- NEVER create flat files like `.moai/specs/SPEC-AUTH-001.md`
- WHY: Directory structure enables multi-file organization
- IMPACT: Flat files break SPEC discovery and metadata storage

Validation Output:

- all_checks_passed: Boolean (true only if ALL 4 checks pass)
- failed_checks: Array of check numbers that failed
- recommendation: Action to resolve failures

### Step 1.5.3: Allowed Domain Names

[HARD] Domain Name Restriction:

SPEC domains MUST be selected from this approved list. Custom domains require justification.

Authentication & Authorization:

- AUTH: User authentication (login, logout, session)
- AUTHZ: Authorization and permissions
- SSO: Single sign-on integration
- MFA: Multi-factor authentication

API & Backend:

- API: REST/GraphQL endpoints
- BACKEND: Server-side logic
- SERVICE: Microservice implementation
- WEBHOOK: Webhook handlers

Frontend & UI:

- UI: User interface components
- FRONTEND: Client-side logic
- COMPONENT: Reusable UI components
- PAGE: Page-level features

Data & Database:

- DB: Database schema changes
- DATA: Data processing
- MIGRATION: Schema migrations
- CACHE: Caching implementation

Infrastructure & DevOps:

- INFRA: Infrastructure changes
- DEVOPS: CI/CD and deployment
- MONITOR: Monitoring and logging
- SECURITY: Security improvements

General Development:

- REFACTOR: Code refactoring
- FIX: Bug fixes
- UPDATE: Feature updates
- PERF: Performance optimization
- TEST: Test infrastructure
- DOCS: Documentation improvements

Composite Domain Rules:

- [SOFT] Maximum 2 domains recommended: `UPDATE-REFACTOR-001`
- [HARD] Maximum 3 domains allowed: `UPDATE-REFACTOR-FIX-001`
- WHY: Excessive domains indicate scope creep
- IMPACT: Complex domains signal SPECs that should be split

### Step 1.5.4: Validation Failure Responses

[HARD] Error Response Requirement:

When validation fails, provide specific error messages and remediation:

Error Type 1: Invalid ID Format

- Message: "SPEC ID format invalid: '{provided_id}'"
- Expected: "SPEC-{DOMAIN}-{NUMBER} (e.g., SPEC-AUTH-001)"
- Action: "Correct the ID format before proceeding"

Error Type 2: Invalid Domain Name

- Message: "Domain '{domain}' not in allowed list"
- Suggestion: "Use one of: AUTH, API, UI, DB, REFACTOR, FIX, UPDATE, ..."
- Action: "Select an approved domain or provide justification for custom domain"

Error Type 3: Duplicate SPEC ID

- Message: "SPEC ID '{id}' already exists at: {path}"
- Suggestion: "Use '{next_available_id}' instead"
- Action: "Choose unique ID or update existing SPEC"

Error Type 4: Flat File Attempt

- Message: "Cannot create flat SPEC file: '{path}'"
- Expected: "Directory structure: .moai/specs/SPEC-{ID}/"
- Action: "Create directory with spec.md, plan.md, acceptance.md"

---

## PHASE 2: SPEC Document Creation (STEP 2 - After Approval)

This phase ONLY executes IF the user selected "Proceed" in Step 3.5.

Your task is to create the SPEC document files in the correct directory structure.

### Critical Rule: Directory Naming Convention

[HARD] SPEC Directory Structure Requirement:

Format requirement: `.moai/specs/SPEC-{ID}/`
WHY: Standardized directory structure enables automated discovery and tooling
IMPACT: Non-standard naming breaks automation and causes deployment failures

Correct Examples of Required Format:

- `SPEC-AUTH-001/` - Domain single, properly formatted
- `SPEC-REFACTOR-001/` - Domain single, properly formatted
- `SPEC-UPDATE-REFACTOR-001/` - Composite domains (2), properly formatted

Examples of Incorrect Formats to Avoid:

- `AUTH-001/` - Missing SPEC- prefix breaks automation
- `SPEC-001-auth/` - Additional text after ID violates convention
- `SPEC-AUTH-001-jwt/` - Additional text after ID violates convention

[EXCEPTION] Direct Glob Usage for SPEC ID Validation:

This command has a selective exception allowing direct Glob tool usage for SPEC ID uniqueness verification.

Usage Pattern:

- Use Glob(".moai/specs/\*_/SPEC-_.md") to check existing SPEC list directly
- Verify new SPEC ID does not conflict with existing ones
- After validation, delegate to manager-spec agent for SPEC creation

WHY: SPEC ID validation is a performance bottleneck (30-40% speedup with direct Glob)
SCOPE: Read-only Glob only; file creation/modification must be delegated to agents
CONSTRAINT: This exception applies ONLY to SPEC ID uniqueness checks, not other operations

[HARD] ID Uniqueness Verification Requirement:

Verification scope: Search entire .moai/specs/ directory before creation
WHY: Duplicate IDs cause merge conflicts and implementation uncertainty
IMPACT: Duplicate IDs create version ambiguity and maintenance chaos

Verification output must include:

- exists: Boolean indicating whether ID already exists
- locations: Array of all conflicting file paths (empty if no conflicts)
- recommendation: Text assessment ("safe to create" or "duplicate found - use ID-XXX instead")

[SOFT] Composite Domain Naming Guidance:

- Allow: `UPDATE-REFACTOR-001` (2 domains maximum)
  WHY: Two domains indicate coordinated work without excessive complexity
  IMPACT: Two-domain SPECs maintain focus and scope

- Caution: `UPDATE-REFACTOR-FIX-001` (3+ domains not recommended)
  WHY: Three or more domains indicate scope creep and mixed concerns
  IMPACT: Complex domain names signal SPECs that should be split

### Step 1: Invoke manager-spec for SPEC creation

Use the manager-spec subagent to:

Create SPEC document files for approved plan

Context Continuity:

- Continue from the SPEC planning phase in Phase 1B
- Use full planning context (project analysis, SPEC candidates, implementation plan) to generate comprehensive SPEC document files

Language Configuration:

- conversation_language: {{CONVERSATION_LANGUAGE}}
- language_name: {{CONVERSATION_LANGUAGE_NAME}}

Critical Language Rules:

- Receive instructions in agent_prompt_language from config (default: English)
- Respond in conversation_language from config (user's preferred language)
- All SPEC documents content must be written in {{CONVERSATION_LANGUAGE}}
- Technical terms and function names remain in English (global standard)

SPEC File Generation Rules (MANDATORY):

[HARD] Create Directory Structure, Not Single Files:

Requirement: Always create folder structure for SPEC documents
WHY: Directory structure enables multi-file organization and metadata storage
IMPACT: Single .md files prevent future tool integration and violate structure assumptions

Correct approach: Create `.moai/specs/SPEC-AUTH-001/` as directory
Incorrect approach: Create `.moai/specs/SPEC-AUTH-001.md` as single file

[HARD] Verify Before Creation:

Requirement: Check directory name format and ID duplicates before writing files
WHY: Pre-flight verification prevents invalid states and merge conflicts
IMPACT: Writing invalid files creates cleanup burden and workflow disruption

[HARD] Quality Gate Compliance:

Requirement: Follow these rules exactly for quality gate to pass
WHY: Quality gates ensure system reliability and consistency
IMPACT: Non-compliance causes pipeline failures and deployment blocks

SPEC Document Creation (Step-by-Step):

Step 1: Verify SPEC ID Format

- Format: SPEC-{DOMAIN}-{NUMBER}
- Examples: SPEC-AUTH-001, SPEC-REFACTOR-001, SPEC-UPDATE-REFACTOR-001
- Wrong: AUTH-001, SPEC-001-auth, SPEC-AUTH-001-jwt

Step 2: Verify ID Uniqueness

- Search .moai/specs/ for existing SPEC files
- If duplicate ID found → Change ID or update existing SPEC
- If ID is unique → Proceed to Step 3

Step 3: Create Directory Structure

- Create directory: .moai/specs/SPEC-{SPEC_ID}/
- Directory creation completes synchronously before Step 4

Step 4: Generate 3 SPEC Files (SIMULTANEOUS - Required)

- Create all 3 files at once:
  - .moai/specs/SPEC-{SPEC_ID}/spec.md
  - .moai/specs/SPEC-{SPEC_ID}/plan.md
  - .moai/specs/SPEC-{SPEC_ID}/acceptance.md

File Requirements:

spec.md Requirements:

- YAML frontmatter with all 7 required fields:
  - id: SPEC-{SPEC_ID}
  - version: "1.0.0"
  - status: "draft"
  - created: "{{YYYY-MM-DD}}"
  - updated: "{{YYYY-MM-DD}}"
  - author: "{{AUTHOR_NAME}}"
  - priority: "{{HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW}}"
- HISTORY section immediately after frontmatter
- Complete EARS structure with all 5 requirement types

plan.md Requirements:

- Implementation plan with detailed steps
- Task decomposition and dependencies
- Resource requirements and timeline
- Technology stack specifications
- Risk analysis and mitigation strategies

acceptance.md Requirements:

- Minimum 2 Given/When/Then test scenarios
- Edge case testing scenarios
- Success criteria and validation methods
- Performance/quality gate criteria

Quality Assurance:

- Information not in product/structure/tech document supplemented by asking new questions
- Acceptance Criteria written at least 2 times in Given/When/Then format
- Number of requirement modules ≤ 5 (if exceeded, include justification in SPEC)

Git Integration:

- Generate commit messages following conventional commits
- Create appropriate branch names based on git strategy
- Include SPEC identifiers in commit messages

---

## PHASE 3: Git Branch and PR Setup (STEP 2 continuation)

### CRITICAL: PHASE 3 Execution is Conditional on Config AND Flags

PHASE 3 executes ONLY IF:

1. PHASE 2 completed successfully
2. One of these conditions is met:
   - `--worktree` flag is provided (NEW: Worktree creation)
   - `--branch` flag is provided OR user chose branch creation
   - Configuration permits branch creation
   - `github.spec_git_workflow` is explicitly configured

PHASE 3 Branch Logic:

- If `--worktree` flag: Skip traditional branch creation, create worktree instead
- If `--branch` flag: Follow traditional branch creation logic
- If no flags: Follow existing AskUserQuestion flow for branch choice

PHASE 3 is SKIPPED IF:

- `github.spec_git_workflow == "develop_direct"` (Direct commits, no branches)
- Configuration validation fails
- User permissions insufficient
- No branch/worktree creation flags provided AND user chooses "no branch"

---

### Step 1: Read and Validate Git Configuration

MANDATORY: Read configuration BEFORE any git operations

Execute configuration validation following this decision process:

Step 1A - Read Configuration:

- Read the configuration file from .moai/config/config.yaml
- Extract git_mode value from git_strategy.mode (expected values: "personal" or "team")
- Extract spec_workflow value from github.spec_git_workflow (this is required)

Step 1B - Validate spec_git_workflow Value:

- Check if spec_workflow is one of the valid values: "develop_direct", "feature_branch", or "per_spec"
- If spec_workflow is not one of these valid values:
  - Report error indicating the invalid spec_git_workflow value
  - Report error listing the valid workflow options
  - Set SKIP_PHASE_3 to true
  - Abort all git operations

Step 1C - Validate Configuration Consistency:

- If git_mode equals "personal" and spec_workflow equals "develop_direct":
  - Configuration is consistent, proceed normally
- If git_mode equals "personal" and spec_workflow equals "feature_branch" or "per_spec":
  - Issue warning that personal mode with branch creation is non-standard but allowed
  - Configuration is acceptable, proceed with caution
- If git_mode equals "team" and spec_workflow equals "feature_branch" or "per_spec":
  - Configuration is consistent, proceed normally
- Otherwise:
  - Report error for inconsistent git configuration
  - Abort all git operations

Step 1D - Log Configuration Status:

- Log the final git configuration showing mode and spec_workflow values

Configuration Validation Decision Logic:

If git_mode equals "personal":

- If spec_workflow equals "develop_direct": PHASE 3 SKIPPED (ROUTE A)
- If spec_workflow equals "feature_branch": PHASE 3 EXECUTES (ROUTE B)
- If spec_workflow equals "per_spec": PHASE 3 WITH USER ASK (ROUTE C)

If git_mode equals "team":

- spec_workflow value is ignored: PHASE 3 EXECUTES (ROUTE D - Team Mode)

---

### Step 2: Branch Creation Logic (All 3 Modes)

All modes use common `branch_creation.prompt_always` configuration

#### Step 2.1: Determine Branch Creation Behavior

Based on config git_strategy.branch_creation.prompt_always:

Step 2.1: Read branch creation configuration

- Read prompt_always from git_strategy.branch_creation.prompt_always
- Default value is true if not specified

Decision Logic:

- If prompt_always equals true: ACTION is ASK_USER_FOR_BRANCH_CREATION
- If prompt_always equals false:
  - If git_mode equals "manual": ACTION is SKIP_BRANCH_CREATION
  - If git_mode equals "personal" or "team": ACTION is AUTO_CREATE_BRANCH

---

#### Step 2.2: Route A - Ask User (When `prompt_always: true`)

CONDITION: `branch_creation.prompt_always == true`

ACTION: Ask user for branch/worktree creation preference

**Step 1: Check auto_branch configuration**

Read configuration value from config.yaml:

- Path: git_strategy.automation.auto_branch
- Default: true

**Step 2: Early exit if auto_branch is disabled**

If auto_branch equals false:

- Set ROUTE to USE_CURRENT_BRANCH
- Skip to Step 2.4 immediately
- Do NOT ask user any questions

**Step 3: Ask user if auto_branch is enabled**

Use AskUserQuestion tool with the following parameters:

- Question: "Create a development environment for this SPEC?"
- Header: "Development Environment"
- MultiSelect: false
- Options:
  1. "Create Worktree" - Create isolated worktree environment (recommended for parallel SPEC development)
  2. "Create Branch" - Create feature/SPEC-{SPEC_ID} branch (traditional workflow)
  3. "Use current branch" - Work directly on current branch

**Step 4: Determine route based on user choice**

Based on user selection:

- If "Create Worktree" selected: Set ROUTE to CREATE_WORKTREE
- If "Create Branch" selected: Set ROUTE to CREATE_BRANCH
- If "Use current branch" selected: Set ROUTE to USE_CURRENT_BRANCH

Next Step: Go to Step 2.5 (worktree), 2.3 (branch), or 2.4 (current) based on route

---

#### Step 2.3: Create Feature Branch (After User Choice OR Auto-Creation)

CONDITION:

- User selected "Create Branch"
- OR (`prompt_always: false` AND git_mode in [personal, team])
- AND `git_strategy.automation.auto_branch == true`

If `auto_branch: false`: Skip to Step 2.4 (Use current branch)

ACTION: Invoke manager-git to create feature branch

Use the manager-git subagent to:

Create feature branch for SPEC implementation

Instructions:

- MODE: {git_mode} (manual/personal/team)
- BRANCH_CREATION: prompt_always = {prompt_always}

Tasks:

1. Create branch: `feature/SPEC-{SPEC_ID}-{description}`
2. Set tracking upstream if remote exists
3. Switch to new branch
4. Create initial commit (if appropriate for mode)

Validation:

- Verify branch was created and checked out
- Verify current branch is feature/SPEC-{SPEC_ID}
- Return branch creation status

Note: PR creation is handled separately in /moai:2-run or /moai:3-sync (Team mode only)

Expected Outcome:

- Feature branch created: feature/SPEC-[SPEC_ID]-description
- Current branch switched to feature branch
- Ready for implementation in /moai:2-run

---

#### Step 2.4: Skip Branch Creation (After User Choice OR Manual Mode)

CONDITION: User selected "Use current branch" OR (`prompt_always: false` AND git_mode == manual)

ACTION: Skip branch creation, continue with current branch

Branch creation skipped:

- SPEC files created on current branch
- NO manager-git agent invoked
- Ready for /moai:2-run implementation
- Commits will be made directly to current branch during DDD cycle

---

#### Step 2.5: Worktree Creation (NEW - When --worktree flag provided)

CONDITION: `--worktree` flag is provided in user command

ACTION: Create Git worktree using WorktreeManager

[HARD] SPEC Commit Before Worktree Creation:

Requirement: When --worktree flag is provided, SPEC files MUST be committed before worktree creation
WHY: Worktree is created from the current commit; uncommitted SPEC files won't exist in the worktree
IMPACT: Uncommitted SPECs cause missing files in worktree and inconsistent state

Step 2.5A - Parse Command Arguments:

- Parse the command arguments from ARGUMENTS variable
- Check if --worktree flag is present in the arguments
- Check if --branch flag is present in the arguments

Step 2.5B - MANDATORY SPEC Commit (when --worktree flag is present):

Before worktree creation, commit SPEC files:

1. Stage SPEC files: `git add .moai/specs/SPEC-{SPEC_ID}/`
2. Create commit with message: `feat(spec): Add SPEC-{SPEC_ID} - {title}`
3. Verify commit was successful before proceeding
4. If commit fails, abort worktree creation and report error

Step 2.5C - Worktree Creation (after SPEC commit):

- Determine project root as the current working directory
- Set worktree root to the user home directory under worktrees/MoAI-ADK
- Initialize the WorktreeManager with project root and worktree root paths
- Create worktree for the SPEC with the following parameters:
  - spec_id: The generated SPEC ID (e.g., SPEC-AUTH-001)
  - branch_name: Feature branch name in format feature/SPEC-{ID}
  - base_branch: main (or current branch with SPEC commit)

Step 2.5D - Success Output:

- Display confirmation that SPEC was created and committed with the SPEC ID
- Display the worktree path that was created
- Provide next steps guidance:
  - Option 1: Switch to worktree using moai-worktree switch command
  - Option 2: Use shell eval with moai-worktree go command
  - Option 3: Run /moai:2-run with the SPEC ID

Step 2.5E - Error Handling:

- If SPEC commit fails:
  - Display error message with the failure reason
  - Abort worktree creation (do NOT create worktree with uncommitted SPEC)
  - Suggest manual commit: `git add .moai/specs/SPEC-{ID}/ && git commit -m "feat(spec): Add SPEC-{ID}"`
  - After manual commit, retry worktree creation

- If worktree creation fails (after successful SPEC commit):
  - Display error message with the failure reason
  - Confirm that the SPEC was committed successfully
  - Provide manual worktree creation command as fallback

Expected Success Outcome:

- SPEC created: SPEC-AUTH-001
- SPEC committed: `feat(spec): Add SPEC-AUTH-001 - {title}`
- Worktree created: ~/worktrees/MoAI-ADK/SPEC-AUTH-001

Next steps:

1. Switch to worktree: moai-worktree switch SPEC-AUTH-001
2. Or use shell eval: eval $(moai-worktree go SPEC-AUTH-001)
3. Then run: /moai:2-run SPEC-AUTH-001

Error Handling:

- If SPEC commit fails: Abort worktree creation, show manual commit instructions
- If worktree creation fails: SPEC is committed, show manual worktree creation instructions
- If worktree already exists: Show switch instructions
- If WorktreeManager not available: Show installation/dependency instructions

---

#### Step 2.6: Team Mode - Create Draft PR (After Branch Creation)

CONDITION: `git_mode == "team"` AND branch was created (Step 2.3) AND NOT `--worktree` flag

ACTION: Create draft PR for team review

Use the manager-git subagent to:

Create draft pull request for SPEC implementation (Team mode only)

Critical Config: git_strategy.mode == "team"
→ Team mode REQUIRES draft PRs for review coordination

Tasks:

1. Create draft PR: feature/SPEC-{SPEC_ID} → main/develop branch
2. PR title: "feat(spec): Add SPEC-{SPEC_ID} [DRAFT]"
3. PR body: Include SPEC ID, description, and checklist
4. Add appropriate labels (spec, draft, etc.)
5. Assign reviewers from team config (if configured)
6. Set PR as DRAFT (do NOT auto-merge)

Validation:

- Verify PR was created in draft status
- Return PR URL and status

Expected Outcome:

- Feature branch: feature/SPEC-[SPEC_ID]
- Draft PR created for team review
- Ready for /moai:2-run implementation

---

### Step 3: Conditional Status Report

Display status based on configuration and execution result:

#### Case 1: Branch Creation Prompted (`prompt_always: true`) - User Selected "Auto create"

```
 Phase 3 Status: Feature Branch Created (User Choice)

 Configuration: git_strategy.mode = "{git_mode}"
 Branch Creation: prompt_always = true → User chose "Auto create"

{IF TEAM MODE:
 Draft PR Created (Team Mode):
- PR Title: "feat(spec): Add SPEC-{SPEC_ID} [DRAFT]"
- Target Branch: develop/main
- Status: DRAFT (awaiting review)
}

 Next Steps:
1.  Review SPEC in `.moai/specs/SPEC-{SPEC_ID}/`
2.  Execute `/moai:2-run SPEC-{SPEC_ID}` to begin implementation
3. 🌿 All commits will be made to feature branch
{IF TEAM MODE:
4.  Share draft PR with team for early review (already created)
5.  Team can comment during development

```
 Phase 3 Status: Direct Commit Mode (User Choice)

 Configuration: git_strategy.mode = "{git_mode}"
 Branch Creation: prompt_always = true → User chose "Use current branch"

 No Branch Created:
- SPEC files created on current branch
- Ready for direct implementation
- Commits will be made directly to current branch

 Next Steps:
1.  Review SPEC in `.moai/specs/SPEC-{SPEC_ID}/`
2.  Execute `/moai:2-run SPEC-{SPEC_ID}` to begin implementation
3.  All commits will be made directly to current branch
4.  Follow DDD: ANALYZE → PRESERVE → IMPROVE cycles
```

---

#### Case 3: Branch Creation Auto-Skipped (Manual Mode + `prompt_always: false`)

```
 Phase 3 Status: Direct Commit Mode (Configuration)

 Configuration: git_strategy.mode = "manual"
 Branch Creation: prompt_always = false → Auto-skipped

 No Branch Created (Manual Mode Default):
- SPEC files created on current branch
- NO manager-git invoked (as configured)
- Ready for direct implementation
- Commits will be made directly to current branch

 Next Steps:
1.  Review SPEC in `.moai/specs/SPEC-{SPEC_ID}/`
2.  Execute `/moai:2-run SPEC-{SPEC_ID}` to begin implementation
3.  Make commits directly to current branch
4.  Follow DDD: ANALYZE → PRESERVE → IMPROVE cycles
```

---

#### Case 4: Branch Creation Skipped with Auto-Enable Prompt (Personal/Team + `prompt_always: false` + `auto_enabled: false`)

```
 Phase 3 Status: Direct Commit Mode (Manual Default for Personal/Team)

 Configuration: git_strategy.mode = "{git_mode}" (personal or team)
 Branch Creation: prompt_always = false, auto_enabled = false → Manual Default

 Branch Creation: Not created yet (pending user approval)
- SPEC files created on current branch
- Ready for implementation
- Commits will be made directly to current branch initially

 Automation Approval Offered:
─────────────────────────────────────────
Would you like to enable automatic branch creation for future SPEC creations?
(This will update your config.yaml)

 Yes  → Set branch_creation.auto_enabled = true
        → Next SPEC will auto-create feature/SPEC-XXX branch

 No   → Keep manual mode
        → Continue working on current branch for this SPEC
        → No config changes made
─────────────────────────────────────────

 Next Steps:
1.  Review SPEC in `.moai/specs/SPEC-{SPEC_ID}/`
2.  Execute `/moai:2-run SPEC-{SPEC_ID}` to begin implementation
3.  Make commits directly to current branch
4.  Follow DDD: ANALYZE → PRESERVE → IMPROVE cycles
5.  Create PR in `/moai:3-sync` when implementation complete
```

---

#### Case 5: Branch Creation Auto-Enabled (Personal/Team + `prompt_always: false` + `auto_enabled: true`)

```
 Phase 3 Status: Feature Branch Created (Auto-Enabled)

 Configuration: git_strategy.mode = "{git_mode}" (personal or team)
 Branch Creation: prompt_always = false, auto_enabled = true → Auto-enabled

 Feature Branch Created:
- Branch: `feature/SPEC-{SPEC_ID}`
- Current branch switched to feature branch
- Ready for implementation on isolated branch

{IF TEAM MODE:
 Draft PR Created (Team Mode):
- PR Title: "feat(spec): Add SPEC-{SPEC_ID} [DRAFT]"
- Target Branch: develop/main
- Status: DRAFT (awaiting review)
}

 Next Steps:
1.  Review SPEC in `.moai/specs/SPEC-{SPEC_ID}/`
2.  Execute `/moai:2-run SPEC-{SPEC_ID}` to begin implementation
3. 🌿 All commits will be made to feature branch
{IF TEAM MODE:
4.  Share draft PR with team for early review
5.  Team can comment on draft PR during development
6.  Finalize PR in `/moai:3-sync` when complete
:ELSE:
4.  Create PR in `/moai:3-sync` when implementation complete
}
```

---

#### Case 6: Worktree Creation (--worktree flag or user choice)

```
 Phase 3 Status: Worktree Created (Isolated Development Environment)

 Worktree Creation: --worktree flag provided OR user chose "Create Worktree"
 SPEC Created: SPEC-{SPEC_ID} documents generated successfully
 SPEC Committed: feat(spec): Add SPEC-{SPEC_ID} - {title}

 Isolated Worktree Created:
- Path: .moai/worktrees/MoAI-ADK/SPEC-{SPEC_ID}/
- Branch: feature/SPEC-{SPEC_ID}
- Base Commit: Contains committed SPEC files
- Status: Ready for parallel development

 Next Steps:
1.  Switch to worktree: `moai-worktree switch SPEC-{SPEC_ID}`
2.  Or use shell eval: `eval $(moai-worktree go SPEC-{SPEC_ID})`
3.  Review SPEC documents in worktree: `.moai/specs/SPEC-{SPEC_ID}/`
4.  Execute `/moai:2-run SPEC-{SPEC_ID}` to begin DDD implementation
5.  Work on isolated environment without affecting other SPECs

 Benefits of Worktree Development:
-  Complete isolation from other SPEC work
- 🔀 Easy switching between multiple SPECs
- 🧹 Automatic cleanup when SPEC is completed
-  Lower memory usage than full repository clones
-  SPEC files guaranteed in worktree (committed before creation)
```

## Output Format

### Output Format Rules

[HARD] User-Facing Reports: Always use Markdown formatting for user communication. Never display XML tags to users.
WHY: Users expect readable formatted text, not markup
IMPACT: XML tags in user output create confusion and reduce comprehension

[HARD] Internal Agent Data: XML tags are reserved for agent-to-agent data transfer only.
WHY: XML structure enables automated parsing for downstream agent coordination
IMPACT: Using XML for user output degrades user experience

### User-Facing Output (Markdown)

Progress reports must use Markdown with clear sections:

**Analysis Output**:

- **Context**: Current project state and relevant files discovered
- **Findings**: SPEC candidates identified with rationale
- **Assessment**: Technical constraints and implementation feasibility
- **Recommendations**: Next steps and decision options

**Plan Output**:

- **Requirements**: Approved SPEC title, ID, priority, and scope
- **Architecture**: Technical stack, dependencies, and integration points
- **Decomposition**: Task breakdown and implementation sequence
- **Validation**: Quality criteria and acceptance conditions

**Implementation Output**:

- **Status**: Phase completion status and artifacts created
- **Artifacts**: Location and format of created SPEC files
- **Validation**: Quality gate results and compliance verification
- **NextSteps**: User guidance for proceeding to implementation phase

### Internal Agent Communication (XML)

For agent-to-agent data transfer only (never displayed to users):

```xml
<analysis>Context, findings, assessment, and recommendations</analysis>
<plan>Requirements, architecture, decomposition, and validation criteria</plan>
<implementation>Status, artifacts, validation results, and next steps</implementation>
```

WHY: Structured output enables parsing for automated workflows and tool integration
IMPACT: Unstructured output prevents downstream automation and creates manual overhead
