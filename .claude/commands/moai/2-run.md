# MoAI-ADK Step 2: Execute Implementation (Run) - TDD Implementation

**User Interaction Architecture**: AskUserQuestion must be used at COMMAND level only. Subagents via Task() are stateless and cannot interact with users. Collect all approvals BEFORE delegating phase execution.

**Execution Model**: Commands orchestrate through `Task()` tool only. No direct tool usage.

**Delegation Pattern**: Sequential phase-based agent delegation with 5 phases (SDD 2025 Standard):
- Phase 1: SPEC analysis and execution plan creation
- Phase 1.5: Tasks decomposition (SDD 2025 - explicit task breakdown)
- Phase 2: TDD implementation (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
- Phase 2.5: Quality validation (TRUST 5 assessment)
- Phase 3: Git commit management
- Phase 4: Completion and next steps guidance

---

## Command Purpose

Execute TDD implementation of SPEC requirements through complete agent delegation.

The `/moai:2-run` command orchestrates the complete implementation workflow by delegating to specialized agents rather than performing tasks directly.

**SPEC ID Parameter**: Supply via `$ARGUMENTS` (e.g., `/moai:2-run SPEC-001`)

---

## Execution Philosophy: "Plan to Run to Sync"

The `/moai:2-run` command executes SPEC implementation through sequential phase-based agent delegation.

### Output Format Rules

[HARD] User-Facing Reports: Always use Markdown formatting for all user communication.

User Report Example (Phase 2.5 Completion):

Phase 2.5 Complete: Quality Verification Passed

TRUST 5 Validation Results:
- Test First: PASS - 14/14 tests passed
- Readable: WARNING - 4 linting warnings (auto-fixable)
- Unified: PASS - Framework patterns followed
- Secured: PASS - No security vulnerabilities
- Trackable: PASS - Changes tracked

Coverage: 90%+
Status: PASS

[HARD] Internal Agent Data: XML tags are reserved for agent-to-agent data transfer only. Never display XML tags to users.

Internal Phase Structure (for agent coordination, not user display):

Phase 1 (1_analysis_planning):
- Agent: manager-strategy
- Output: Execution plan with requirements and success criteria
- Checkpoint: User approval required

Phase 2 (2_tdd_implementation):
- Agent: manager-tdd
- Output: Code with passing tests (at least 85% coverage)
- Checkpoint: Implementation complete

Phase 2.5 (2_5_quality_validation):
- Agent: manager-quality
- Output: TRUST 5 assessment (PASS/WARNING/CRITICAL)
- Checkpoint: Quality gates verified

Phase 3 (3_git_operations):
- Agent: manager-git
- Output: Feature branch with meaningful commits
- Checkpoint: Commits created and verified

Phase 4 (4_completion_guidance):
- Agent: AskUserQuestion
- Output: Summary and next steps options
- Checkpoint: User directed to /moai:3-sync

### Tool Usage Discipline [HARD]

This command **MUST** only use these three tool categories:

- **Task()**: Delegates to specialized agents (manager-strategy, manager-tdd, manager-quality, manager-git)
  - WHY: Maintains architectural clarity and separation of concerns
  - IMPACT: Ensures each phase remains focused and reusable

- **AskUserQuestion()**: Obtains user approval and next steps guidance AT COMMAND LEVEL ONLY
  - WHY: Subagents via Task() are stateless and cannot interact with users
  - IMPACT: Expecting agents to use AskUserQuestion causes workflow failures
  - CORRECT: Command collects approvals, passes decisions to agents as parameters

- **TodoWrite()**: Tracks task progress across phases
  - WHY: Maintains visibility into long-running implementation workflows
  - IMPACT: Enables recovery and debugging if phases fail

- **Agents handle all direct tool usage** (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob)
  - WHY: Command stays lightweight; agents bring domain expertise
  - IMPACT: Reduces command complexity by 71% while improving reliability

The command orchestrates phases sequentially; specialized agents handle all implementation complexity.

---

## Agent Invocation Patterns (CLAUDE.md Compliance)

This command uses agent execution patterns defined in CLAUDE.md (lines 96-120).

### Sequential Phase-Based Chaining PASS

Command implements strict sequential chaining through 5 phases:

Phase Flow:
- Phase 1: Analysis & Planning (manager-strategy subagent)
- Phase 2: TDD Implementation (manager-tdd subagent with RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
- Phase 2.5: Quality Validation (manager-quality subagent with TRUST 5 assessment)
- Phase 3: Git Operations (manager-git subagent for commits and branch)
- Phase 4: Completion Guidance (AskUserQuestion for next steps)

Each phase receives outputs from all previous phases as context.

WHY: Sequential execution ensures TDD discipline and quality gates
- Phase 2 requires approved execution plan from Phase 1
- Phase 2.5 validates Phase 2 implementation before git operations
- Phase 3 requires validated code from Phase 2.5
- Phase 4 provides guidance based on complete implementation status

IMPACT: Skipping phases or parallel execution would violate TDD cycle and bypass quality gates

### Parallel Execution FAIL

Not applicable - TDD workflow requires sequential execution

WHY: Test-Driven Development mandates specific ordering
- Cannot write tests in parallel with implementation (RED phase first)
- Cannot validate quality before implementation completes
- Cannot commit code before quality validation passes

IMPACT: Parallel execution would break TDD discipline and compromise code quality

### Resumable Agent Support PASS

Command supports resume pattern after interruptions:

Resume Command:
- `/moai:2-run SPEC-XXX` (retry same command)
- Resumes from last successful phase checkpoint
- Preserves execution context and implementation state

WHY: Complex implementations may encounter interruptions or token limits
IMPACT: Resume capability prevents loss of implementation progress and enables recovery

---

Refer to CLAUDE.md "Agent Chaining Patterns" (lines 96-120) for complete pattern architecture.

---

## Command Implementation

### Sequential Phase Execution Pattern

Command executes phases sequentially with decision checkpoints between each phase. Below is the implementation workflow describing tool calls and decision logic:

**Phase 1: SPEC Analysis and Planning**

Phase 1 Execution Steps:
- Invoke the manager-strategy subagent to analyze the provided SPEC ID
- The subagent performs the following analysis:
  - Extract requirements and success criteria from the SPEC
  - Identify implementation phases and individual tasks
  - Determine the tech stack and dependencies required
  - Estimate complexity and effort for the implementation
  - Present a step-by-step execution strategy
- The subagent returns a detailed execution plan for user review

User Approval Checkpoint (HARD requirement):
- Present the execution plan to the user using AskUserQuestion
- Question: "Does this execution plan look good?"
- Header: "Plan Review"
- Provide three options:
  - "Proceed with plan" - Start implementation
  - "Modify plan" - Request changes to the plan
  - "Postpone" - Stop here and continue later
- If user does not select "Proceed with plan": Exit execution and await further instructions

**Phase 2: TDD Implementation**

Phase 2 Execution Steps:
- Invoke the manager-tdd subagent with context from Phase 1 plan result
- The subagent executes complete TDD implementation for the approved plan:
  - Write failing tests first (RED phase)
  - Implement minimal code to pass tests (GREEN phase)
  - Refactor for quality improvements (REFACTOR phase)
  - Ensure test coverage meets or exceeds 85%
  - Verify all tests are passing
- The subagent returns implementation files with passing test suite and coverage metrics

**Phase 2.5: Quality Validation**

Phase 2.5 Execution Steps:
- Invoke the manager-quality subagent with context containing both plan and implementation results
- The subagent validates implementation against TRUST 5 principles:
  - T (Test-first): Verify tests exist and pass
  - R (Readable): Verify code is clear and documented
  - U (Unified): Verify implementation follows project patterns
  - S (Secured): Verify no security vulnerabilities present
  - T (Trackable): Verify changes are logged and traceable
- Additionally verify test coverage meets or exceeds 85%
- The subagent returns quality assessment with status (PASS, WARNING, or CRITICAL) and specific findings

Quality Gate Decision (HARD requirement):
- If quality status is CRITICAL (not PASS or WARNING):
  - Present quality issues to user using AskUserQuestion
  - Question: "Quality validation failed. Review issues and try again?"
  - Provide option to return to implementation phase
  - Exit current execution flow

**Phase 3: Git Operations**

Phase 3 Execution Steps:
- Invoke the manager-git subagent with full context from all previous phases (plan, implementation, quality)
- The subagent creates commits for SPEC implementation:
  - Create feature branch with naming format feature/SPEC-[ID]
  - Stage all relevant files including implementation and tests
  - Create meaningful commits using conventional commit format
  - The complete context from planning, implementation, and quality review ensures commits are semantically meaningful
  - Verify commits were created successfully
- The subagent returns commit summary with SHA references and branch name

**Phase 4: Completion and Guidance**

Phase 4 Execution Steps:
- Present next steps to user using AskUserQuestion
- Question: "Implementation complete. What would you like to do next?"
- Header: "Next Steps"
- Provide four options:
  - "Sync Documentation" - Execute /moai:3-sync to synchronize documentation
  - "Implement Another Feature" - Execute /moai:1-plan to define another SPEC
  - "Review Results" - Examine the implementation and test coverage
  - "Finish" - Session complete

Completion Summary:
- Return final status indicating COMPLETE
- Include the branch name from git operations
- Include the commit count from git operations
- Include the user's selected next action

### Context Flow & Propagation [HARD]

Each phase builds on previous phase outputs, maintaining full context throughout execution:

**Phase 1 → Phase 2**:
- Phase 1 output: Execution plan with architecture and success criteria
- Phase 2 receives: Planning context to guide implementation decisions
- WHY: Prevents re-reading SPEC and ensures consistent architectural approach
- IMPACT: 30% faster implementation with better alignment to original plan

**Phase 2 → Phase 2.5**:
- Phase 2 output: Implementation code and test suite
- Phase 2.5 receives: Both planning context and implementation for validation
- WHY: Quality validation understands design intent before assessing execution
- IMPACT: Reduces false positives and context-aware validation findings

**Phase 2.5 → Phase 3**:
- Phase 2.5 output: Quality assessment and specific findings
- Phase 3 receives: Planning, implementation, and quality context
- WHY: Git commits explain not just what changed, but why based on quality findings
- IMPACT: Produces semantically meaningful commits with quality rationale

**Key Benefits**:

- **Context Continuity**: Full knowledge chain eliminates re-analysis
- **Unified Coding**: Phase 1 architectural decisions naturally propagate through implementation
- **Semantic Commits**: manager-git understands complete context for meaningful commit messages
- **Quality Awareness**: Phase 3 commits can reference specific quality improvements made

---
