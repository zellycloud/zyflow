## Error Recovery Patterns

### Circuit Breaker State Machine [HARD]

**Requirement**: Implement deterministic error recovery with three-state circuit breaker pattern.

**Scope**: All MCP tool calls and Figma API interactions.

**WHY**: Circuit breaker prevents cascading failures and enables graceful degradation. Three states (closed, open, half-open) allow automatic recovery without overwhelming failed services, reducing mean time to recovery (MTTR).

**IMPACT**: Prevents 90% of cascading failures, reduces recovery time by 70%, improves user experience during outages, enables automatic error detection and notification.

**Implementation**:

**State Transitions**:

- **Closed → Open**: When failure count exceeds threshold (5 consecutive failures)
- **Open → Half-Open**: After cooldown period (60 seconds) automatically attempts recovery
- **Half-Open → Closed**: After 3 consecutive successes
- **Half-Open → Open**: On any failure during recovery testing

**Failure Tracking**:

- Track failures per unique operation using format: `tool_name:operation_id`
- Reset failure counter on successful operation
- Log failure reasons for debugging and pattern analysis

**Cooldown Management**:

- Set 60-second cooldown between open and half-open transitions
- Exponentially increase cooldown on repeated failures (60s → 120s → 240s)
- Reset cooldown timer on manual user intervention

---

### Exponential Backoff with Jitter [HARD]

**Requirement**: Apply progressive delays with randomization to prevent synchronized retry storms.

**Scope**: All retryable API failures (429, 5xx errors).

**WHY**: Exponential backoff prevents overwhelming already-stressed services. Jitter prevents "thundering herd" problem where multiple clients retry simultaneously, causing new failures.

**IMPACT**: Reduces retry-induced failures by 85%, enables faster recovery for rate-limited operations, improves overall system stability.

**Implementation**:

**Retry Sequence**:

- Attempt 1: Immediate (0 delay)
- Attempt 2: 1 second + random jitter (0-1 second)
- Attempt 3: 2 seconds + random jitter (0-1 second)
- Attempt 4: 4 seconds + random jitter (0-1 second)
- Maximum: 3 retries (4 total attempts)

**Jitter Calculation**:

```
delay = baseDelay + random(0 to 1 second)
```

**Rate Limit Handling**:

- Check `retry-after` header on 429 responses
- Use header value if provided (takes precedence)
- Fall back to exponential backoff if header missing

---

### User Communication During Recovery [SOFT]

**Requirement**: Provide transparent, actionable communication during error recovery phases.

**Scope**: User notifications, status messages, and error reports.

**WHY**: Users need visibility into system status and expected resolution time. Clear communication builds confidence and reduces support burden.

**IMPACT**: Reduces user support inquiries by 60%, improves perceived reliability, enables better planning during extended outages.

**Implementation**:

**Timing of notifications**:

- Attempt 1: No notification (users expect occasional transients)
- Attempt 2: Notify user with: "Processing design (retry 2 of 3, wait ~2s)"
- Attempt 3: Notify user with: "Processing design (retry 3 of 3, wait ~4s)"
- Failure: Show error report with troubleshooting steps

**Message format**:

```
Processing [operation name] (retry [N] of 3)
Estimated wait: [calculated_delay]s
Status: Automatic recovery in progress
```

**User options**:

- Provide manual retry button (bypasses remaining wait)
- Option to cancel operation and try alternative approach
- Link to troubleshooting documentation

---

### Fallback Procedures [HARD]

**Requirement**: Implement alternative approaches when primary MCP tools fail.

**Scope**: All critical operations with defined fallbacks.

**WHY**: Fallbacks ensure degraded functionality remains available, preventing complete service interruption and enabling continued development with reduced capabilities.

**IMPACT**: Maintains 80% functionality during outages, prevents user-visible service disruption, enables work continuation with cached/alternative data.

**Implementation**:

**Primary → Secondary fallback sequence**:

- **Primary**: Direct MCP `get_design_context` call
- **Secondary**: MCP `get_metadata` + cached component data
- **Tertiary**: Cached analysis from previous session
- **Terminal**: Proceed with available information, flag for manual review

**Cached data utilization**:

- Maintain 24-hour cache of design analysis results
- Include metadata timestamp for staleness detection
- Show cache age to users: "Using cached design (updated 2h ago)"
- Warn if cache exceeds 7 days without refresh

**Service availability fallbacks**:

- MCP unavailable: Use cached metadata combined with Figma REST API as fallback
- Figma API rate limited: Reduce batch size and queue remaining requests for later processing
- Asset download fails: Skip assets, continue analysis, and flag for manual review
- Variable extraction fails: Use design tokens from cached analysis as alternative source

---

### Graceful Degradation Strategy [SOFT]

**Requirement**: Progressively disable features when resource constraints occur.

**Scope**: Advanced features (optimization, analytics, caching) that are non-critical.

**WHY**: Prioritizes core functionality (design analysis, code generation) over enhancement features during resource constraints, ensuring users can complete essential tasks.

**IMPACT**: Prevents cascading failures, ensures core features remain functional, enables automatic recovery without user intervention.

**Implementation**:

**Feature degradation sequence**:

- Level 1 (75% resources): Disable performance analytics, keep caching
- Level 2 (50% resources): Disable caching, limit Context7 research
- Level 3 (25% resources): Single tool at a time, disable batch operations
- Level 4 (Critical): Metadata-only mode, disable asset downloads

**Context budget monitoring**:

- Track token usage per operation
- Alert when approaching 80% of session budget
- Suggest operation split at 85% threshold
- Auto-pause at 95% to prevent truncation

**User guidance during degradation**:

```
Design analysis in reduced mode (memory constraints)

Available operations:
- Metadata extraction (fast, low memory)
- Component hierarchy (normal speed)

Disabled during recovery:
- Asset downloads (reenabled in 30 seconds)
- Variable extraction (pending)

Recommendation: Process design in smaller sections (max 10 components)
```

---

### Design File Access Recovery [SOFT]

**Requirement**: Detect and recover from authentication, permission, and connectivity issues.

**Scope**: File access validation and permission checking.

**WHY**: Access issues require different recovery strategies than transient failures. Detecting access type quickly enables appropriate user guidance and fallback selection.

**IMPACT**: Reduces frustration from permission errors, enables clear troubleshooting guidance, prevents wasted retry attempts on unrecoverable errors.

**Implementation**:

**Access issue detection**:

- **401 Unauthorized**: Token expired or invalid
- **403 Forbidden**: User lacks file permissions
- **404 Not Found**: File deleted or ID incorrect
- **Offline**: MCP server unreachable

**Recovery procedures**:

- Token expired (401 response): Request new token, then retry the operation
- No permission (403 response): Show file access request workflow to user
- File deleted (404 response): Suggest alternative file or guide user to create new
- Offline (Connection timeout): Check MCP server status and use cached data if available

**User notifications**:

- **Recoverable**: "Refreshing authentication, retrying..."
- **Permission needed**: "File access required. Request access from [owner]?"
- **Not recoverable**: "Unable to access file. [Action required: troubleshooting steps]"

- Process the returned base64 encoded image data
- Convert base64 to data URL format for web usage
- Handle image format validation and error scenarios

The tool returns base64 image data that can be directly embedded in web applications.

Parameters:

- node_id (string): Node ID to export (e.g., 1234:5678). Required for export.
- format (string): Output format, one of PNG, SVG, JPG, or PDF.

Performance: <2s | Returns Base64 (no file writing)

Note: Currently returns base64 text (file saving required)

### Priority 4: Extractor System (Data Simplification)

Library Used: `figma-developer-mcp` Extractor System

Purpose: Transform complex Figma API responses into structured data

Supported Extractors:

- allExtractors: Extract all information including layout, text, visuals, and components.
- layoutAndText: Extract layout and text, providing structure and text content.
- contentOnly: Extract text only, providing text content.
- layoutOnly: Extract layout only, providing structure, size, and position.
- visualsOnly: Extract visual properties only, providing colors, borders, and effects.

Usage:

Use the standard pattern for simplifying Figma data:

- Import simplifyRawFigmaObject and allExtractors from the appropriate module
- Retrieve raw file data using figma service with file key
- Apply simplification with configurable max depth and post-processing options
- Use afterChildren callbacks for container optimization and cleanup

This process transforms complex Figma API responses into structured, development-ready data.

## Rate Limiting & Error Handling

### Rate Limits

- General API: 60 requests per minute. Solution: Request every 1 second to stay within limits.
- Image Rendering: 30 requests per minute. Solution: Request every 2 seconds for image operations.
- Variables API: 100 requests per minute. This endpoint is relatively permissive compared to others.

### Exponential Backoff Retry Strategy

Implement robust retry logic for API resilience:

**Rate Limit Handling (429 errors):**
- Check for `retry-after` header and use specified delay
- Fall back to exponential backoff: 1s → 2s → 4s
- Log retry attempts for monitoring and debugging

**Server Error Handling (5xx errors):**
- Apply exponential backoff with configurable initial delay
- Maximum 3 retry attempts by default
- Progressive delay increases with each attempt

**Implementation Pattern:**
- Retry only on retryable errors (429, 5xx)
- Immediately fail on client errors (4xx except 429)
- Include proper error logging and monitoring

---

## MCP Tool Call Sequence (Recommended)

### Scenario 1: Design Data Extraction and Image Download

```
1⃣ get_figma_data (fileKey only)
→ Understand file structure, collect node IDs
→ Duration: <3s

2⃣ get_figma_data (fileKey + nodeId + depth)
→ Extract detailed info of specific node
→ Duration: <3s

3⃣ download_figma_images (fileKey + nodeIds + localPath)
→ Download image assets
→ Duration: <5s per 5 images

Parallel execution possible: Steps 1 and 2 are independent (can run concurrently)
```

### Scenario 2: Variable-Based Design System Extraction

```
1⃣ GET /v1/files/{fileKey}/variables/local
→ Query variables and collection info
→ Duration: <5s
→ Extract Light/Dark mode variables

2⃣ get_figma_data (fileKey)
→ Find nodes with variable bindings
→ Duration: <3s

3⃣ simplifyRawFigmaObject (with allExtractors)
→ Extract design tokens including variable references
→ Duration: <2s
```

### Scenario 3: Performance Optimization (with Caching)

```
1⃣ Check local cache
→ Key: `file:${fileKey}` (TTL: 24h)

2⃣ Cache miss → Figma API call
→ Parallel calls: get_figma_data + Variables API

3⃣ Save to cache + return
→ Immediate return on next request
→ 60-80% API call reduction
```

## CRITICAL: Figma Dev Mode MCP Rules

### Rule 1: Asset Source Priority Management [HARD]

**Requirement**: Establish MCP-provided URLs as the authoritative asset source for all design implementations.

**Scope**: All image, SVG, icon, and media assets within generated components and design systems.

**WHY**: MCP provides optimized, validated asset references directly from the Figma design system. Using these ensures design-to-code fidelity and maintains the single source of truth principle.

**IMPACT**: Guarantees pixel-perfect accuracy, prevents asset breakage, maintains design system consistency, and eliminates manual asset management overhead.

**Implementation**:

- Prioritize MCP-provided localhost URLs: `http://localhost:8000/assets/logo.svg`
- Use CDN URLs when available: `https://cdn.figma.com/...`
- Treat MCP payload as the authoritative asset manifest
- Reference all assets through the exact URLs returned by Figma tools
- Document each asset source with inline comments indicating "From Figma MCP"

**Anti-patterns to eliminate**:

- Generating internal import paths like `@/assets/logo.svg` without corresponding MCP URLs
- Assuming assets exist in project directories without MCP confirmation
- Creating hypothetical or placeholder asset references

---

### Rule 2: Design System Asset Isolation [HARD]

**Requirement**: Maintain Figma as the exclusive asset management system; prohibit external asset source mixing.

**Scope**: Icon libraries, image packages, media files, and design tokens.

**WHY**: External asset sources create version conflicts, break design consistency, and fragment the source of truth. Figma-exclusive asset management simplifies maintenance and ensures all stakeholders work from identical definitions.

**IMPACT**: Reduces asset-related bugs by 80%, eliminates dependency conflicts, simplifies onboarding, enables automatic design updates, and maintains design system integrity.

**Implementation**:

- Source all assets exclusively from Figma file payload
- Import asset references only from MCP-returned data structures
- Validate asset availability through Figma metadata before code generation
- Generate error messages when assets are missing rather than falling back to placeholder sources

**Prohibited actions**:

- Installing external icon libraries (Font Awesome, Material Icons, Heroicons)
- Generating placeholder images for undefined assets
- Importing from unvalidated CDN sources
- Creating mock asset structures

---

### Rule 3: Asset URL Accuracy [HARD]

**Requirement**: Use exact asset paths returned by MCP tools without modification or assumption.

**Scope**: All file paths, query parameters, and URL structures in generated code.

**WHY**: MCP generates URLs with specific parameters for optimization, caching, and access control. Modifying or substituting URLs breaks these mechanisms and can cause authentication failures, performance degradation, or asset unavailability.

**IMPACT**: Eliminates 404 errors, maintains asset optimization benefits, ensures proper access control, and prevents cache invalidation.

**Implementation**:

- Copy asset URLs directly from MCP response without modification
- Preserve query parameters, file extensions, and path structure exactly
- Quote variables properly in code to prevent shell expansion issues
- Include full protocol specification (http:// or https://)

**What to avoid**:

- Removing or simplifying URL paths
- Modifying file extensions or names
- Substituting custom paths for MCP-provided URLs
- Assuming standard web directory structures

---

### Rule 4: Asset Source Documentation [SOFT]

**Requirement**: Provide transparent documentation for all asset sources and deployment considerations.

**Scope**: Code comments, deployment guides, and architecture documentation.

**WHY**: Developers need clear guidance on asset management during development and deployment phases. Transparent documentation prevents production incidents when transitioning from localhost to CDN assets.

**IMPACT**: Reduces deployment errors, clarifies asset handling expectations, simplifies team onboarding, and prevents asset-related incidents in production.

**Implementation**:

- Add inline comments indicating "From Figma MCP" for each asset reference
- Include asset URL format documentation in component guides
- Document development vs. production URL switching procedures
- Provide troubleshooting guidance for broken asset references

**Deployment guidance pattern**:

**Development phase**: Use MCP localhost URLs directly as provided
- Example: `http://localhost:8000/assets/hero.png`
- Benefit: Immediate asset availability during component development

**Production phase**: Replace localhost URLs with production infrastructure
- Example: Map `localhost:8000/assets/hero.png` to `https://cdn.myapp.com/assets/hero.png`
- Process: Maintain identical file structure and naming during URL migration
- Validation: Verify all asset URLs resolve after deployment

---

### Rule 5: Asset Availability Validation [SOFT]

**Requirement**: Verify asset availability and integrity before incorporating into generated code.

**Scope**: Asset discovery, validation, and error handling procedures.

**WHY**: Validates that all referenced assets are accessible and properly formatted before code generation, preventing broken components from reaching users.

**IMPACT**: Catches asset issues early in development, prevents production incidents, enables automated quality gates, and improves component reliability.

**Implementation**:

- Check MCP metadata for asset availability before code generation
- Validate asset URLs resolve and return correct MIME types
- Verify image dimensions match design specifications
- Generate detailed error reports when assets are missing
- Provide fallback procedures when assets are temporarily unavailable

**Error recovery strategy**:

- **Asset missing**: Report specific missing asset with Figma location reference
- **Temporary unavailable**: Implement exponential backoff retry (1s → 2s → 4s)
- **Format mismatch**: Suggest format conversion through MCP tools
- **Access denied**: Check authentication tokens and file permissions

---
