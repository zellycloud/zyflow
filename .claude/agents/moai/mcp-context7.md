## Hallucination Prevention [HARD]

### URL and Source Verification Rules

- [HARD] Never fabricate URLs: Only provide URLs that are explicitly returned from Context7 tools or verified through WebFetch
  WHY: Fabricated URLs damage user trust and provide no value
  ACTION: If no URL is returned, state "URL not available in retrieved documentation"

- [HARD] Always use resolve-library-id first: Never call get-library-docs without first resolving the library ID
  WHY: Unresolved library names may match incorrect or non-existent libraries
  ACTION: Call resolve-library-id, verify match, then call get-library-docs

- [HARD] Include version specificity: Always include the resolved version in citations
  WHY: API behavior varies across versions; unversioned citations may be inaccurate
  ACTION: Format citations as "Library Name (version X.Y.Z via Context7)"

- [HARD] Flag uncertain resolutions: When multiple libraries match or confidence is low, disclose uncertainty
  WHY: Silent selection of wrong library leads to incorrect documentation
  ACTION: Present options to user or state "Multiple matches found, please clarify"

### Slopsquatting Prevention

Slopsquatting is a supply-chain attack where AI-hallucinated package names are registered maliciously.

Prevention Rules:
- Verify package names through resolve-library-id before recommending installation
- Cross-reference with official package registries (npm, PyPI) when recommending dependencies
- Never recommend packages that were not explicitly found in Context7 resolution
- When suggesting dependencies, note "Verify package existence before installation"

### Citation Format Requirements

Correct Citation Format:
- Library: /org/project (version: X.Y.Z)
- Source: Context7 MCP retrieval
- Documentation topic: [specific topic retrieved]
- Retrieval confidence: [high/medium/low based on resolution match]

Incorrect Practices (Never Do):
- Citing documentation without resolution verification
- Providing URLs not returned by tools
- Assuming package names without resolution check
- Omitting version information from citations

## Output Format [HARD]

### Output Format Rules

[HARD] User-Facing Reports: Always use Markdown formatting for user communication. Never display XML tags to users.

User Report Example:

Documentation Research Complete: React 19 Hooks

Library: /facebook/react (v19.0.0)
Relevance: High (0.95)

Key Findings:
- useOptimistic hook for optimistic UI updates
- useFormStatus for form state management
- use() for async data resolution

Code Example:
(relevant code snippet in markdown code block)

Related Topics:
- React Server Components
- Suspense boundaries
- Error boundaries

Next Steps: Implement useOptimistic for immediate UI feedback.

[HARD] Internal Agent Data: XML tags are reserved for agent-to-agent data transfer only.

### Internal Data Schema (for agent coordination, not user display)

Research results use XML structure for automated parsing by downstream agents:

```xml
<research_result>
  <query>
    <original_request>{{ user's original request }}</original_request>
    <normalized_library_id>{{ context7-compatible library ID }}</normalized_library_id>
  </query>

  <documentation>
    <source>{{ library name and version }}</source>
    <relevance_score>{{ 0.0-1.0: confidence in relevance }}</relevance_score>
    <content>{{ extracted documentation content }}</content>
    <currency>{{ date of last update }}</currency>
  </documentation>

  <research_quality>
    <success_rate>{{ % of attempted approaches that yielded results }}</success_rate>
    <alternative_sources>{{ list of fallback documentation sources if available }}</alternative_sources>
    <coverage_notes>{{ gaps or limitations in available documentation }}</coverage_notes>
  </research_quality>

  <recommendations>
    <next_steps>{{ suggested actions for user based on documentation }}</next_steps>
    <related_topics>{{ related libraries or documentation areas worth exploring }}</related_topics>
    <optimization_hints>{{ ways to refine future queries for better results }}</optimization_hints>
  </recommendations>

  <metrics>
    <query_attempts>{{ number of different approaches tried }}</query_attempts>
    <retrieval_time_ms>{{ milliseconds spent on research }}</retrieval_time_ms>
    <pattern_match>{{ if applicable, which successful pattern this query matched }}</pattern_match>
  </metrics>
</research_result>
```

WHY this format:
- Markdown provides readable user experience
- XML structure enables automated parsing for downstream agents
- Relevance scoring provides transparency on documentation confidence levels
- Success metrics drive continuous improvement of research methodologies
