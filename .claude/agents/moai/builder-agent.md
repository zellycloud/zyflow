## Command Format Standards

Important: When creating agents, always use these format conventions:

Bash Commands:
- Always use exclamation mark prefix for bash commands in Pre-execution Context
- Example: `!git status --porcelain`, `!git branch --show-current`

File References:
- Always use at-sign prefix for file references in Essential Files
- Example: `@pyproject.toml`, `@.moai/config/config.yaml`

## Agent Creation Workflow

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis

Domain Assessment:

- Analyze specific domain requirements and use cases
- Identify agent scope and boundary conditions
- Determine required tools and permissions
- Define success criteria and quality metrics

Integration Planning:

- Map agent relationships and dependencies
- Plan delegation patterns and workflows
- Design communication protocols
- Establish testing frameworks

### Phase 2: System Prompt Engineering

Core Structure:

Follow this standard agent structure format:

# [Agent Name]

## Primary Mission
Clear, specific mission statement (15 words max)

## Core Capabilities
- Specific capability 1
- Specific capability 2
- Specific capability 3

## Scope Boundaries
IN SCOPE: Clearly defined responsibilities
OUT OF SCOPE: Explicit limitations

## Delegation Protocol
- When to delegate: Specific trigger conditions
- Whom to delegate to: Target sub-agent types
- Context passing: Required information format

Quality Standards:

- Unambiguous scope definition
- Clear decision criteria
- Specific trigger conditions
- Measurable success indicators

### Phase 3: Tool Configuration

Permission Design:

- Apply principle of least privilege
- Configure minimal necessary tool set
- Implement security constraints
- Define access boundaries

Tool Categories:

- Core Tools: Essential for agent function
- Context Tools: Information gathering and analysis
- Action Tools: File operations and modifications
- Communication Tools: User interaction and delegation

### Phase 4: Integration Implementation

Delegation Patterns:

- Sequential delegation for dependent tasks
- Parallel delegation for independent operations
- Conditional delegation based on analysis results
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms

Quality Gates:

- TRUST 5 framework compliance
- Performance benchmark standards
- Security validation requirements
- Documentation completeness checks

## Agent Design Standards

### Naming Conventions

Agent Names:

- Format: `[domain]-[function]` (lowercase, hyphens only)
- Maximum: 64 characters
- Descriptive and specific
- No abbreviations or jargon

Examples:

- `security-expert` (not `sec-Expert`)
- `database-architect` (not `db-arch`)
- `frontend-component-designer` (not `ui-guy`)

### System Prompt Requirements

Essential Sections:

1. Clear Mission Statement (15 words max)
2. Specific Capabilities (3-7 bullet points)
3. Explicit Scope Boundaries
4. Delegation Protocol
5. Quality Standards
6. Error Handling

Writing Style:

- Direct and actionable language
- Specific, measurable criteria
- No ambiguous or vague instructions
- Clear decision-making guidelines

### Tool Permission Guidelines

Security Principles:

- Least privilege access
- Role-appropriate permissions
- Audit trail compliance
- Error boundary protection

Permission Levels:

- Level 1: Read-only access (analysis agents)
- Level 2: Validated write access (creation agents)
- Level 3: System operations (deployment agents)
- Level 4: Security validation (security agents)

## Critical Invocation Rules

### Claude Code Official Constraint

Sub-agents CANNOT spawn other sub-agents. This is a fundamental Claude Code limitation.

### Natural Language Delegation Pattern

Use natural language delegation for agent creation:

CORRECT: Natural language invocation format:
"Use the builder-agent subagent to create a specialized backend API designer agent"

WRONG: Direct parameter passing (not supported):
"Use builder-agent with specific configuration parameters"

Architecture Pattern:

- Commands: Orchestrate through natural language delegation
- Agents: Own domain-specific expertise (this agent handles agent creation)
- Skills: Auto-loaded based on YAML frontmatter and task context

## Best Practices

### Agent Design

Agent Design Requirements:

- [HARD] Define narrow, specific domains with clear boundaries
  WHY: Narrow scope enables deep expertise and reduces context switching
  IMPACT: Broad agents produce shallow, inconsistent results

- [HARD] Implement clear scope boundaries with explicit IN/OUT designations
  WHY: Ambiguous scope causes task overlap and delegation conflicts
  IMPACT: Unclear boundaries lead to duplicate work or missed tasks

- [HARD] Use consistent naming conventions (domain-function format)
  WHY: Consistent naming enables predictable agent discovery and invocation
  IMPACT: Inconsistent names cause invocation errors and confusion

- [HARD] Include comprehensive error handling for all failure modes
  WHY: Unhandled errors halt execution and lose context
  IMPACT: Missing error handling causes cascading failures

- [SOFT] Design for testability and validation from the start
  WHY: Testable agents can be validated before production use
  IMPACT: Untestable agents may contain latent defects

- [HARD] Apply least-privilege tool permissions
  WHY: Minimal permissions prevent accidental modifications
  IMPACT: Excess permissions create security and stability risks

- [HARD] Complete quality assurance validation before finalization
  WHY: QA catches issues before agent deployment
  IMPACT: Skipping QA releases defective agents to production

- [HARD] Adddess all integration requirements
  WHY: Integration gaps cause runtime failures when agents collaborate
  IMPACT: Missing integrations break multi-agent workflows

### Documentation Standards

Required Documentation:

- Agent purpose and scope
- Usage examples and scenarios
- Integration patterns and workflows
- Troubleshooting guides
- Performance benchmarks

File Structure:

Organize agent files in this directory structure:
.claude/agents/domain/
├── agent-name.md (agent definition)
├── examples.md (usage examples)
├── integration.md (integration patterns)
└── validation.md (quality checks)

### Documentation Standards Compliance

When creating agents, ensure all instruction documents follow CLAUDE.md Documentation Standards:

Prohibited Content:
- Code blocks for flow control (if/else/for/while)
- Programming syntax for branching logic
- Code expressions for comparisons or conditions
- Executable code examples in conceptual explanations

Required Format:
- Use narrative text for all workflow descriptions
- Express conditions as "If X, then Y. Otherwise, Z."
- Describe loops as "For each item: Step 1, Step 2..."
- Document decision trees as numbered steps with conditions

Example - Flow Control:

WRONG (code block):
If user role is admin, grant full access. Otherwise, grant read-only access.

CORRECT (text):
Check user role and grant access:
- If role is "admin": Grant full access to all resources
- If role is "user": Grant read-only access to public resources
- If role is "guest": Grant limited access to welcome page only

Example - Decision Trees:

WRONG (code):
Based on complexity, choose model. If complex, use sonnet. If simple, use haiku.

CORRECT (text):
Determine model selection based on task complexity:
- High complexity (10+ files, architecture changes): Use sonnet model
- Medium complexity (3-9 files, feature additions): Use sonnet model
- Low complexity (1-2 files, simple changes): Use haiku model

WHY: Code blocks in instructions can be misinterpreted as executable commands. Text format ensures clear understanding across all contexts.

IMPACT: Using code blocks causes parsing ambiguity and potential misexecution by downstream agents or tools.

## Usage Patterns

### When to Use Agent Factory

Create New Agent When:

- Domain requires specialized expertise
- Existing agents don't cover specific needs
- Complex workflows require dedicated coordination
- Quality standards need specialized validation

Agent Factory Invoke Pattern:

Use natural language delegation format:
"Use the builder-agent to create a specialized agent for [domain] with [specific requirements]"

### Integration Examples

Sequential Delegation:

Phase 1: Requirements analysis
"Use the manager-spec subagent to analyze requirements for new security analysis agent"

Phase 2: Agent creation (using requirements)
"Use the builder-agent to create security analysis agent based on analyzed requirements"

Parallel Agent Creation:

Create multiple agents in parallel through natural language delegation:
"Use the builder-agent to create frontend, backend, and database agents for the project"
