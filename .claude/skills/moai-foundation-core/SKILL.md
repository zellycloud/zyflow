# MoAI Foundation Core

Foundational principles and architectural patterns that power MoAI-ADK's AI-driven development workflow.

Core Philosophy: Quality-first, test-driven, modular, and efficient AI development through proven patterns and automated workflows.

## Quick Reference (30 seconds)

What is MoAI Foundation Core?
Six essential principles that ensure quality, efficiency, and scalability in AI-powered development:

1. TRUST 5 Framework - Quality gate system (Test-first, Readable, Unified, Secured, Trackable)
2. SPEC-First TDD - Specification-driven test-driven development workflow
3. Delegation Patterns - Task orchestration via specialized agents (never direct execution)
4. Token Optimization - 200K budget management and context efficiency
5. Progressive Disclosure - Three-tier knowledge delivery (Quick → Implementation → Advanced)
6. Modular System - File splitting and reference architecture for scalability

Quick Access:
- Quality standards → [TRUST 5 Module](modules/trust-5-framework.md)
- Development workflow → [SPEC-First TDD Module](modules/spec-first-tdd.md)
- Agent coordination → [Delegation Patterns Module](modules/delegation-patterns.md)
- Budget management → [Token Optimization Module](modules/token-optimization.md)
- Content structure → [Progressive Disclosure Module](modules/progressive-disclosure.md)
- File organization → [Modular System Module](modules/modular-system.md)
- Agent catalog → [Agents Reference Module](modules/agents-reference.md) NEW
- Command reference → [Commands Reference Module](modules/commands-reference.md) NEW
- Security & constraints → [Execution Rules Module](modules/execution-rules.md) NEW

Use Cases:
- New agent creation with quality standards
- New skill development with structural guidelines
- Complex workflow orchestration
- Token budget planning and optimization
- Documentation architecture design
- Quality gate configuration

## Implementation Guide (5 minutes)

### 1. TRUST 5 Framework - Quality Assurance System

Purpose: Automated quality gates ensuring code quality, security, and maintainability.

Five Pillars:

Test-first Pillar:
- Requirement: Maintain test coverage at or above 85 percent
- Validation: Execute pytest with coverage reporting
- Failure Action: Block merge and generate missing tests
- WHY: High coverage ensures code reliability and reduces production defects
- IMPACT: Catches bugs early, reduces debugging time by 60-70 percent

Readable Pillar:
- Requirement: Use clear and descriptive naming conventions
- Validation: Execute ruff linter checks
- Failure Action: Issue warning and suggest refactoring improvements
- WHY: Clear naming improves code comprehension and team collaboration
- IMPACT: Reduces onboarding time by 40 percent, improves maintenance velocity

Unified Pillar:
- Requirement: Apply consistent formatting and import patterns
- Validation: Execute black formatter and isort checks
- Failure Action: Auto-format code or issue warning
- WHY: Consistency eliminates style debates and merge conflicts
- IMPACT: Reduces code review time by 30 percent, improves readability

Secured Pillar:
- Requirement: Comply with OWASP security standards
- Validation: Execute security-expert agent analysis
- Failure Action: Block merge and require security review
- WHY: Security vulnerabilities create critical business and legal risks
- IMPACT: Prevents 95+ percent of common security vulnerabilities

Trackable Pillar:
- Requirement: Write clear and structured commit messages
- Validation: Match Git commit message regex patterns
- Failure Action: Suggest proper commit message format
- WHY: Clear history enables debugging, auditing, and collaboration
- IMPACT: Reduces issue investigation time by 50 percent

Integration Points:
- Pre-commit hooks → Automated validation
- CI/CD pipelines → Quality gate enforcement
- Agent workflows → core-quality validation
- Documentation → Quality metrics

### 2. SPEC-First TDD - Development Workflow

Purpose: Specification-driven development ensuring clear requirements before implementation.

Three-Phase Workflow:

```
Phase 1: SPEC (/moai:1-plan)
 workflow-spec → EARS format
 Output: .moai/specs/SPEC-XXX/spec.md
 Execute /clear (saves 45-50K tokens)

Phase 2: TDD (/moai:2-run)
 RED: Failing tests
 GREEN: Passing code
 REFACTOR: Optimize
 Validate: ≥85% coverage

Phase 3: Docs (/moai:3-sync)
 API documentation
 Architecture diagrams
 Project reports
```

EARS Format:
- Ubiquitous: System-wide (always active)
- Event-driven: Trigger-based (when X, do Y)
- State-driven: Conditional (while X, do Y)
- Unwanted: Prohibited (shall not do X)
- Optional: Nice-to-have (where possible, do X)

Token Budget: SPEC 30K | TDD 180K | Docs 40K | Total 250K

Key Practice: Execute /clear after Phase 1 to initialize context.

Detailed Reference: [SPEC-First TDD Module](modules/spec-first-tdd.md)

---

### 3. Delegation Patterns - Agent Orchestration

Purpose: Task delegation to specialized agents, avoiding direct execution.

Core Principle [HARD]: Alfred must delegate all work through Task() to specialized agents.

WHY: Direct execution bypasses specialization, quality gates, and token optimization.
IMPACT: Proper delegation improves task success rate by 40 percent and enables parallel execution.

Delegation Syntax:
```python
result = await Task(
 subagent_type="specialized_agent",
 prompt="Clear, specific task",
 context={"relevant": "data"}
)
```

Three Patterns:

Sequential (dependencies):
```python
design = Task(subagent_type="api-designer", prompt="Design API")
code = Task(subagent_type="backend-expert", prompt="Implement", context={"design": design})
```

Parallel (independent):
```python
results = await Promise.all([
 Task(subagent_type="backend-expert", prompt="Backend"),
 Task(subagent_type="frontend-expert", prompt="Frontend")
])
```

Conditional (analysis-based):
```python
analysis = Task(subagent_type="debug-helper", prompt="Analyze")
if analysis.type == "security":
 Task(subagent_type="security-expert", prompt="Fix")
```

Agent Selection:
- Simple (1 file): 1-2 agents sequential
- Medium (3-5 files): 2-3 agents sequential
- Complex (10+ files): 5+ agents mixed

Detailed Reference: [Delegation Patterns Module](modules/delegation-patterns.md)

### 4. Token Optimization - Budget Management

Purpose: Efficient 200K token budget through strategic context management.

Budget Allocation:

SPEC Phase:
- Token Budget: 30K tokens
- Strategy: Load requirements only, execute /clear after completion
- WHY: Specification phase requires minimal context for requirement analysis
- IMPACT: Saves 45-50K tokens for implementation phase

TDD Phase:
- Token Budget: 180K tokens
- Strategy: Selective file loading, load only implementation-relevant files
- WHY: Implementation requires deep context but not full codebase
- IMPACT: Enables 70 percent larger implementations within budget

Docs Phase:
- Token Budget: 40K tokens
- Strategy: Result caching and template reuse
- WHY: Documentation builds on completed work artifacts
- IMPACT: Reduces redundant file reads by 60 percent

Total Budget:
- Combined Budget: 250K tokens across all phases
- Strategy: Phase separation with context reset between phases
- WHY: Clean context boundaries prevent token bloat
- IMPACT: Enables 2-3x larger projects within same budget

Token Saving Strategies:

1. Phase Separation: /clear between phases
 - After /moai:1-plan (saves 45-50K)
 - When context > 150K
 - After 50+ messages

2. Selective Loading: Load only necessary files

3. Context Optimization: 20-30K tokens target

4. Model Selection: Sonnet (quality) | Haiku (speed/cost)

Monitoring: /context command, track budget, suggest /clear

Cost Savings: Haiku 70% cheaper → 60-70% total savings
