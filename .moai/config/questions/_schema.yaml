# AskUserQuestion Constraints (Claude Code)
constraints:
  max_questions_per_call: 4
  max_options_per_question: 4
  supports_multi_select: true
  auto_includes_other: true
  no_emoji_allowed: true

# Question Types
question_types:
  select_single:
    description: "Single selection from options"
    multi_select: false
    # UX Guidelines:
    # - Provide clear, distinct options (max 4 per question)
    # - Include descriptive text for each option
    # - Use "(recommended)" suffix for default/preferred options
  select_multiple:
    description: "Multiple selection from options"
    multi_select: true
    # UX Guidelines:
    # - Clearly indicate "multiple selections allowed" in question text
    # - Limit to 4 options maximum
  text_input:
    description: "Text input via 'Type something' field (auto-added by AskUserQuestion tool)"
    use_other_for_input: true
    # UX Guidelines for text_input questions:
    # - Only include 'Keep Current Value' option for existing values
    # - DO NOT include 'Change' or 'Other' options - they confuse users
    # - Include guidance in question text: "To change, type in the text field below"
    # - The 'Type something...' input field is automatically added by the tool
    # - Users type directly in this auto-added field for custom values
    # IMPORTANT: Never use {{prompt_user}} - it is DEPRECATED
  number_input:
    description: "Number input via 'Type something' field or predefined numeric values"
    use_other_for_input: true
    # UX Guidelines for number_input questions:
    # - Provide common preset values as options (max 4)
    # - Include guidance in question text: "To enter a custom number, type in the text field below"
    # - DO NOT include 'Other' option with {{prompt_user}} - it is DEPRECATED
    # - Users type custom numbers directly in the auto-added 'Type something...' field
    # - Include valid range in question text if applicable (e.g., "0-100", "1-168")
    # IMPORTANT: Never use {{prompt_user}} - it is DEPRECATED

# Conditional Logic Operators
condition_operators:
  basic:
    - equals
    - not_equals
    - in
    - not_in
  compound:
    - and           # All conditions must be true
    - or            # At least one condition must be true
  usage_notes:
    simple_condition: "condition: {field: 'git_strategy.mode', operator: 'equals', value: 'personal'}"
    compound_condition: |
      condition:
        operator: and
        conditions:
          - {field: 'git_strategy.mode', operator: 'not_equals', value: 'manual'}
          - {field: 'git_strategy.{mode}.auto_branch', operator: 'equals', value: true}

# Special Values
special_values:
  "{{current}}": "Keep current value from config"
  "{{field_path}}": "Reference another field value"
  # DEPRECATED: "{{prompt_user}}" - DO NOT USE
  # Reason: For text_input, users type directly in 'Type something' field
  # Instead of a 'Change' option, include guidance in the question text
